# Agent Orchestration State Files
# These files are runtime state and should generally not be committed
# However, you may choose to commit them to track progress across team members

# Uncomment the lines below if you want to ignore state files:
# progress.json
# dependency-graph.json
# tasks/*.json

# Always keep the roadmap for reference
# !roadmap.md

# Keep example files for documentation
!README.md
!examples/
