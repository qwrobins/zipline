## Next Actions

### Immediate (Now)
1. **Wait for Story 1.2 review** to complete
2. **Address Story 1.3 review feedback**:
   - Read: `docs/code_reviews/1.3-code-review.md`
   - Fix 3 critical security issues
   - Re-run tests
   - Update status to "Ready for Review"
   - Run `/review-story 1.3`

### Soon (After Current Work)
3. **Start Story 1.4** once both 1.2 and 1.3 are approved

### Commands to Run
```bash
# Check current status
/story-status

# When 1.3 is fixed and ready
/review-story 1.3

# When 1.2 and 1.3 are both approved
/next-story  # Will start 1.4
```

## Notes

- **Wave 1 completed successfully**: Both stories approved on first review
- **Wave 2 experiencing delays**: Story 1.3 needs security fixes
- **Wave 3 blocked**: Cannot proceed until Wave 2 completes
- **Average iterations**: 1.25 per story (including rework)
- **Review success rate**: 60% approved on first try

## Risk Factors

‚ö†Ô∏è **Story 1.3 Security Issues**: Critical security vulnerabilities found in password reset implementation. Must be addressed before Story 1.4 can begin.

‚è∞ **Story 1.2 Review Pending**: In review for 15 minutes. Expected to complete soon.

üéØ **Story 1.4 Dependency Chain**: Blocked by two stories. Any delays in Wave 2 will delay Wave 3.

## Estimated Completion

Based on current progress:
- **Wave 2**: ~1-2 hours (pending 1.3 fixes and 1.2 review)
- **Wave 3**: ~2-3 hours (after Wave 2 completes)
- **Total Remaining**: ~3-5 hours

**Note**: Estimates assume no additional review cycles needed.
