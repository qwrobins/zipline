# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Build a non-trivial web app to test AI development workflows (requirements → user stories → implementation → tests)
- Create a realistic social feed application (Twitter/Reddit-style) using only JSONPlaceholder API
- Demonstrate complete CRUD operations with optimistic UI patterns without requiring backend infrastructure
- Provide an accessible, zero-setup application requiring no authentication or user accounts
- Validate the BMAD workflow system with a real-world project scenario

## Background Context

The Mini Social Feed project addresses the need for a realistic testing ground for AI-assisted development workflows. Traditional demo applications often oversimplify real-world complexity or require extensive backend setup that distracts from workflow experimentation. By leveraging JSONPlaceholder's public API and implementing mock CRUD with optimistic UI patterns, this project creates a non-trivial application that mimics production patterns (state management, form handling, error boundaries, loading states) while remaining completely self-contained and accessible. The app enables anyone to instantly experience a fully functional social platform without authentication barriers, making it ideal for demonstrating development methodologies and AI agent coordination.
