# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The Mini Social Feed aims to deliver a familiar, intuitive social media experience that feels polished and production-ready despite its mock backend. The interface should emphasize clarity, responsiveness, and immediate feedback through optimistic UI patterns. Users should feel the application is "real" with smooth interactions, loading states, and visual feedback that mirrors modern social platforms like Twitter or Reddit.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Optimistic UI First**: All write operations (comments, todos) update immediately with visual confirmation via toast notifications
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Post lists show summaries; clicking reveals full details with comments
- **Inline Actions**: Quick actions (todo toggle, comment delete) available directly in context without modal dialogs
- **Search-as-you-type**: Real-time filtering of posts and todos as users enter search terms
- **Persistent Navigation**: Global navigation menu provides consistent access to Posts, Users, and Todos sections

## Core Screens and Views

- **Posts Feed** (`/`) - Paginated post list with search/filter controls and author avatars
- **Post Detail** (`/posts/[id]`) - Full post content with nested comments section and comment management
- **User Directory** (`/users`) - Grid or list of all users with avatars and basic info
- **User Profile** (`/users/[id]`) - User details, address map placeholder, posts tab, and todos tab
- **Global Todos** (`/todos`) - Filterable todo list across all users with status toggles

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Leveraging shadcn/ui (Radix primitives), the application will meet WCAG AA standards including:
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus visible indicators
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Screen reader compatibility
- Skip navigation links

## Branding

Minimal, clean design following modern SaaS aesthetics:
- Neutral color palette with accent colors for actions
- System font stack for readability
- Generous whitespace and clear visual hierarchy
- Subtle shadows and borders for depth
- Avatar generation using user initials with color-coded backgrounds

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Responsive web application optimized for:
- Desktop browsers (1024px+)
- Tablet devices (768px-1023px)
- Mobile devices (320px-767px)
- Touch and mouse/keyboard interactions
