## Story Structure

Each story follows a consistent template structure:

1. **Status** - Current state (Draft, Approved, InProgress, Review, Done)
2. **Story** - User story in "As a...I want...so that" format
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - Numbered list of requirements
4. **Tasks / Subtasks** - Detailed implementation checklist with AC references
5. **Dev Notes** - Comprehensive technical details with architecture citations
   - Data Models
   - API Services
   - React Query Hooks
   - Component Specifications
   - Testing Requirements
6. **Change Log** - Document version history
7. **Dev Agent Record** - Implementation details (filled by dev agent)
8. **QA Results** - Testing outcomes (filled by QA agent)

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Dev Notes**: Each story includes extracted architecture details with source citations
- **Self-Contained**: Stories provide all context needed without referencing external architecture docs
- **Testing Focused**: Every story includes unit, integration, and E2E testing requirements
- **AC Mapping**: Tasks reference specific acceptance criteria for traceability
- **Architecture Aligned**: All technical details sourced from docs/architecture/

## Implementation Order

Stories should generally be implemented in numeric order:
1. Complete Epic 1 (foundation and infrastructure)
2. Complete Epic 2 (user features)
3. Complete Epic 3 (engagement features)
4. Complete Epic 4 (todo management)

However, some stories can be parallelized within an epic after core dependencies are met.
