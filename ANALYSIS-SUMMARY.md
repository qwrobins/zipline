## Expected Impact

### Before Improvements (Current State)
```
Stories Requiring Re-Review: 21% (3/14)
Average Issues Per Story: 1.2
Critical Issues: 14% (2/14)
Time to Approval: 1-2 review cycles
```

### After Improvements (Projected)
```
Stories Requiring Re-Review: <10% (1/14)
Average Issues Per Story: <0.5
Critical Issues: 0%
Time to Approval: 1 review cycle (first-pass approval)
```

### ROI Calculation
- **Review Time Saved**: 40% reduction in review iterations
- **Developer Time Saved**: 2-3 hours per story requiring re-review
- **Quality Improvement**: 90% reduction in critical issues
- **Confidence Increase**: Higher first-pass approval rate

**Total Time Saved Per Sprint** (assuming 10 stories):
- Current: 3 stories × 2 hours = 6 hours wasted on re-reviews
- After: 1 story × 2 hours = 2 hours
- **Savings**: 4 hours per sprint (40% reduction)
