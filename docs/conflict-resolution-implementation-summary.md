```

## Features Implemented

### 1. File Ownership Tracking

**Purpose:** Track which files are being modified by which stories to detect overlaps early

**Script:** `agents/lib/file-tracker.sh`

**Capabilities:**
- Register files for a story
- Auto-detect changed files in worktree
- Check for conflicts with other stories
- List all file ownership
- Track potential conflicts in registry

**Registry Format:**
```json
{
  "file_ownership": {
    "src/auth/login.ts": {
      "story_id": "1.1",
      "agent": "javascript-developer",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "worktree": ".worktrees/agent-javascript-developer-1-1-20240107-120000",
      "registered_at": "2024-01-07T12:00:00Z"
    }
  },
  "potential_conflicts": [
    {
      "file": "src/config/app.ts",
      "stories": ["1.1", "1.2"],
      "severity": "high",
      "detected_at": "2024-01-07T12:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Auto-register files after agent makes changes
./agents/lib/file-tracker.sh auto-register "1.1" "javascript-developer" "$WORKTREE_PATH"

# Check for conflicts
./agents/lib/file-tracker.sh check "1.2" src/auth/login.ts

# List ownership
./agents/lib/file-tracker.sh list

# Unregister after merge
./agents/lib/file-tracker.sh unregister "1.1"
```

### 2. Conflict Detection

**Purpose:** Detect potential conflicts before attempting merge

**Script:** `agents/lib/conflict-detector.sh`

**Capabilities:**
- Detect overlapping file changes
- Assess conflict severity (low/medium/high/critical)
- Test merge without committing
- Provide detailed conflict information

**Detection Process:**
1. Get files changed in worktree
2. Get files changed in main since worktree creation
3. Find overlapping files
4. Analyze each overlap for severity
5. Return JSON with conflict details

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "conflicts": [
    {
      "file": "src/auth/login.ts",
      "severity": "high"
    }
  ],
  "severity": "high"
}
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Detect conflicts
./agents/lib/conflict-detector.sh detect "$WORKTREE_PATH"

# Test merge
./agents/lib/conflict-detector.sh test-merge "$WORKTREE_PATH"
```

### 3. Conflict-Resolver Agent

**Purpose:** AI agent that analyzes conflicts and proposes intelligent resolutions

**Definition:** `agents/definitions/conflict-resolver.md`

**Capabilities:**
1. **Analyze Conflicts:** Understand both versions and their intent
2. **Understand Context:** Read surrounding code and story descriptions
3. **Propose Solutions:** Suggest intelligent merge strategies
4. **Assess Risk:** Evaluate confidence level and potential risks
5. **Provide Alternatives:** Offer multiple resolution options

**Resolution Strategies:**
- **Merge Both:** Complementary changes that can coexist
- **Keep Version A/B:** One version supersedes the other
- **Refactor:** Extract common, support both features
- **Sequential:** Chain changes in order
- **Manual Review:** Too complex for automatic resolution

**Output Format:**
```markdown
## Conflict Analysis
[File, versions, conflict type, severity]

## Proposed Resolution
[Strategy, reasoning, confidence, resolved code, changes, risks, tests]

## Alternative Resolutions
[Alternative strategies with reasoning]
```

**Confidence Levels:**
- **High (90-100%):** Clear complementary changes, low risk
- **Medium (70-89%):** Some complexity, moderate risk
- **Low (50-69%):** Significant complexity, higher risk
- **Manual Review (<50%):** Too complex or risky

### 4. Orchestrator Integration

**Purpose:** Coordinate conflict detection and resolution in the workflow

**Modified:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md`

**New Workflow Step (3a):**

```
1. Agent completes work
2. Orchestrator detects conflicts
3. If conflicts found:
   a. Assess severity
   b. For high/critical: invoke conflict-resolver BEFORE merge
   c. For low/medium: attempt merge, invoke resolver if fails
4. Conflict-resolver analyzes and proposes resolution
5. Orchestrator presents to user for approval
6. User reviews and approves
7. Apply resolution
8. Complete merge
9. Cleanup worktree
```

**Key Features:**
- Early conflict detection before merge
- Severity-based handling
- AI-assisted resolution proposals
- User approval required
- Graceful fallback to manual resolution

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: No Conflicts (Happy Path)

```
1. Agent completes Story 1.1
2. Orchestrator detects conflicts → None found
3. Merge succeeds
4. Cleanup worktree
5. Proceed to code review
```

### Example 2: Low Severity Conflicts

```
1. Agent completes Story 1.2
2. Orchestrator detects conflicts → Low severity
3. Attempt merge → Succeeds (no actual conflict)
4. Cleanup worktree
5. Proceed to code review
```

### Example 3: High Severity Conflicts (AI Resolution)

```
1. Agent completes Story 1.3
2. Orchestrator detects conflicts → High severity
3. Invoke conflict-resolver agent
4. Conflict-resolver analyzes:
   - Story 1.3 adds validation
   - Main branch added logging
   - Both are complementary
5. Conflict-resolver proposes: Merge both
6. Orchestrator presents to user:
   - Analysis
   - Proposed resolution
   - Confidence: 95%
7. User approves
8. Apply resolution
9. Merge succeeds
10. Cleanup worktree
11. Proceed to code review
```

### Example 4: Complex Conflicts (Manual Resolution)

```
1. Agent completes Story 1.4
2. Orchestrator detects conflicts → Critical severity
3. Invoke conflict-resolver agent
4. Conflict-resolver analyzes:
   - Story 1.4 changes pricing logic
   - Main branch also changed pricing
   - Conflicting business logic
5. Conflict-resolver recommends: Manual review required
6. Orchestrator presents to user:
   - Analysis
   - Reason for manual review
   - Conflicting code sections
7. User manually resolves
8. User completes merge
9. Cleanup worktree
10. Proceed to code review
```

## Usage Guide

### For Orchestrator

**During story implementation:**

```bash
# 1. Create worktree
WORKTREE_PATH=$(./agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "1.1" "javascript-developer")

# 2. Agent does work...

# 3. Auto-register files (optional)
./agents/lib/file-tracker.sh auto-register "1.1" "javascript-developer" "$WORKTREE_PATH"

# 4. Detect conflicts before merge
CONFLICT_RESULT=$(./agents/lib/conflict-detector.sh detect "$WORKTREE_PATH")

# 5. If conflicts detected, invoke conflict-resolver
@agent-conflict-resolver, please analyze conflicts...

# 6. Present resolution to user
# 7. Apply approved resolution
# 8. Merge and cleanup
```

### For Conflict-Resolver Agent

**When invoked:**

1. Read conflict information
2. Analyze both versions
3. Understand story context
4. Propose resolution with reasoning
5. Assess confidence and risk
6. Provide alternatives if applicable

### For Users

**When presented with conflict resolution:**

1. Review the analysis
2. Understand the proposed resolution
3. Check confidence level
4. Consider alternatives
5. Approve or choose manual resolution

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios

1. **No Conflicts:**
   - Two stories modifying different files
   - Should merge without issues

2. **Complementary Changes:**
   - Story A adds validation
   - Story B adds logging
   - Should propose: Merge both

3. **Superseding Changes:**
   - Story A: Basic implementation
   - Story B: Complete rewrite
   - Should propose: Keep Story B

4. **Conflicting Logic:**
   - Story A: Add tax
   - Story B: Add discount
   - Should recommend: Manual review

5. **Complex Refactoring:**
   - Both stories refactor same function
   - Should assess severity and recommend approach

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning:** Learn from past resolutions
2. **Semantic Analysis:** Deeper code understanding
3. **Test-Driven Resolution:** Run tests to validate
4. **Conflict Prediction:** Predict during planning
5. **Auto-Apply Low-Risk:** Automatically apply high-confidence resolutions
6. **Dependency Analysis:** Better merge ordering
7. **Integration with CI/CD:** Automated testing of resolutions

## Success Metrics

**Target Metrics:**
- 80% reduction in merge conflicts (through prevention)
