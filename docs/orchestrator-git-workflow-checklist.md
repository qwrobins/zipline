# Orchestrator Git Workflow Checklist

## üö® CRITICAL: This checklist is MANDATORY for ALL story implementations

## Phase 7: Before ANY Story Implementation

### Step 1: Check Git Status (REQUIRED)
```bash
git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
```

**If command succeeds:**
- ‚úÖ Git is initialized
- ‚úÖ Proceed to Step 3 (Enforce Worktree Workflow)

**If command fails:**
- ‚ùå Git is NOT initialized
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Proceed to Step 2 (Initialize Git)

---

### Step 2: Initialize Git (AUTOMATIC - NO USER INTERVENTION)

**Run these commands automatically:**

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Create .gitignore if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -f .gitignore ]; then
  cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
node_modules/
.env
.env.local
dist/
build/
.DS_Store
*.log
.agent-orchestration/
.worktrees/
EOF
fi

# Create initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Verify initialization succeeded
git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
```

**Error Handling:**

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `git init` fails | STOP and report: "Failed to initialize git repository. Please check git installation." |
| Initial commit fails | STOP and report: "Failed to create initial commit. Please check file permissions." |
| Verification fails | STOP and report: "Git initialization verification failed. Please initialize git manually." |

**After successful initialization:**
- ‚úÖ Report to user: "‚úÖ Git repository initialized successfully. Proceeding with worktree workflow."
- ‚úÖ Proceed to Step 3

---

### Step 3: Enforce Worktree Workflow (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES:**

- ‚úÖ Git worktree workflow is MANDATORY for ALL story implementations
- ‚úÖ There are NO exceptions to using git worktrees
- ‚úÖ Even if git was just initialized, worktrees MUST be used
- ‚ùå NEVER proceed with story implementation without worktrees
- ‚ùå NEVER work directly in the main repository
- ‚ùå NEVER ask user if they want to use worktrees

**If worktree creation fails:**
- ‚ùå STOP and report the error to the user
- ‚ùå Do NOT attempt to work without worktrees
- ‚úÖ Provide troubleshooting guidance

---

## Before Each Wave: Pre-Wave Verification

### Verify Git Initialization (MANDATORY CHECK)

**Before launching ANY agents, run this verification:**

```bash
# Verify git is initialized
if ! git rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "ERROR: Git is not initialized. This should have been caught in Phase 7 initialization."
  echo "Please ensure git is initialized before proceeding."
  exit 1
fi
```

**If verification fails:**
- ‚ùå STOP immediately
- ‚ùå Report: "CRITICAL ERROR: Git not initialized. Cannot proceed with worktree workflow."
- ‚ùå Do NOT attempt to launch any agents
- ‚úÖ Return to Phase 7 git initialization step

**If verification succeeds:**
- ‚úÖ Proceed to create worktrees for wave

---

## For Each Story: Worktree Creation

### Create Worktree with Verification (MANDATORY)

```bash
# Create worktree
WORKTREE_PATH=$(./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "{story_id}" "{assigned_agent}")

# Verify worktree creation succeeded
if [ -z "$WORKTREE_PATH" ] || [ ! -d "$WORKTREE_PATH" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Failed to create worktree for story {story_id}"
  echo "Worktree workflow is MANDATORY. Cannot proceed without it."
  exit 1
fi
```

**If worktree creation succeeds:**
- ‚úÖ Save worktree path in task state
- ‚úÖ Proceed to launch agent

**If worktree creation fails:**
- ‚ùå STOP immediately
- ‚ùå Report error to user
- ‚ùå Do NOT launch agent
- ‚ùå Do NOT attempt to work without worktree

---

## Agent Invocation: MANDATORY Worktree Instructions

### Message Template for Agents

```
@agent-{assigned_agent}, please implement story {story_id}.

Story file: {story_file}

üö® CRITICAL: Git worktree workflow is MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS üö®

Git has been initialized and your isolated worktree has been created at: {worktree_path}

‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST work in the worktree - NEVER work directly in the main repository.
‚ö†Ô∏è The worktree workflow is REQUIRED for conflict prevention.
‚ö†Ô∏è There are NO exceptions to this requirement.

Follow these steps EXACTLY:
1. Design Planning
2. Reference Analysis
3. **Switch to worktree** (MANDATORY): cd {worktree_path}
4. **Verify you're in worktree**: pwd (should show .worktrees/agent-...)
5. Design-First Implementation
6. Progressive Validation
7. Commit all changes
8. Return to repo root: cd ../../
9. Design Quality Gate
10. **Merge worktree**: ./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh merge "{worktree_path}"
11. **Cleanup worktree**: ./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh cleanup "{worktree_path}"

**If you encounter ANY issues with the worktree workflow:**
- STOP immediately
- Report the error to the orchestrator
- Do NOT attempt to work without the worktree
```

## Quick Decision Tree

```
START
  ‚Üì
Is git initialized?
  ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Proceed to worktree workflow
  ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Initialize git automatically
            ‚Üì
          Did initialization succeed?
            ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Report success ‚Üí Proceed to worktree workflow
            ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí STOP and report error
                      ‚Üì
                    Do NOT proceed with story implementation

Worktree Workflow
  ‚Üì
Create worktree for story
  ‚Üì
Did worktree creation succeed?
  ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Launch agent in worktree
  ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí STOP and report error
            ‚Üì
          Do NOT launch agent
          Do NOT work without worktree
```

### ‚ùå NEVER Do These:

1. ‚ùå Ask user if they want to use git worktrees
2. ‚ùå Skip git initialization and proceed anyway
3. ‚ùå Skip worktree workflow if git was just initialized
4. ‚ùå Allow agents to work directly in main repository
5. ‚ùå Proceed with story implementation if git init fails
6. ‚ùå Proceed with story implementation if worktree creation fails
7. ‚ùå Make worktree workflow optional or conditional

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS Do These:

1. ‚úÖ Check git status before ANY story implementation
2. ‚úÖ Automatically initialize git if missing
3. ‚úÖ Verify git initialization succeeded
4. ‚úÖ Enforce MANDATORY worktree workflow (NO EXCEPTIONS)
5. ‚úÖ Verify worktree creation succeeded
6. ‚úÖ STOP if git initialization fails
7. ‚úÖ STOP if worktree creation fails
8. ‚úÖ Report clear error messages
9. ‚úÖ Provide troubleshooting guidance

## Error Messages Reference

### Git Not Installed
```
ERROR: Failed to initialize git repository. Please check git installation.

Troubleshooting:
1. Verify git is installed: git --version
2. Install git if missing
3. Retry story implementation
```

### Git Init Failed
```
ERROR: Failed to create initial commit. Please check file permissions.

Troubleshooting:
1. Check file permissions in project directory
2. Ensure you have write access
3. Check for .git directory conflicts
4. Retry story implementation
```

### Git Verification Failed
```
ERROR: Git initialization verification failed. Please initialize git manually.

Troubleshooting:
1. Run: git init
2. Run: git add .
3. Run: git commit -m "Initial commit"
4. Retry story implementation
```

### Worktree Creation Failed
```
ERROR: Failed to create worktree for story {story_id}
Worktree workflow is MANDATORY. Cannot proceed without it.

Troubleshooting:
1. Check git repository is initialized
2. Verify .worktrees directory is writable
3. Check for existing worktrees with same name
4. Review git worktree manager logs
```

### Git Not Initialized (Pre-Wave Check)
```
CRITICAL ERROR: Git not initialized. Cannot proceed with worktree workflow.

This should have been caught in Phase 7 initialization.
Please ensure git is initialized before proceeding.

Action: Return to Phase 7 git initialization step
```
