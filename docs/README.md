## Documentation Standards

All documentation in this directory follows these standards:
- **Format:** Markdown (.md)
- **Naming:** UPPERCASE for major documents, kebab-case for sections
- **Structure:** Each subdirectory includes a README.md for navigation
- **Links:** Relative links to maintain portability
