# Slash Commands vs Agents: When to Use Each

## Overview

This document explains when to use **slash commands** vs **agents** in the development workflow.

---

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide

### Use Slash Commands When:
- ✅ Task is **straightforward** and **well-defined**
- ✅ You want **fast execution**
- ✅ You need **predictable output**
- ✅ Task follows a **standard template**
- ✅ No complex decision-making required

### Use Agents When:
- ✅ Task requires **complex reasoning**
- ✅ Need **adaptive behavior** based on context
- ✅ Task involves **multiple tools** and **research**
- ✅ Output varies significantly based on input
- ✅ Need **iterative problem-solving**

## 📊 Comparison Table

| Aspect | Slash Commands | Agents |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Execution Speed** | ⚡ Fast (seconds) | 🐌 Slower (minutes) |
| **Complexity** | Simple, linear | Complex, adaptive |
| **Context Size** | Small (< 300 lines) | Large (500-2000 lines) |
| **Predictability** | High | Variable |
| **Tool Usage** | Minimal | Extensive |
| **Research** | None | context7, web-search |
| **Planning** | None | sequential_thinking |
| **Best For** | Templates, automation | Development, analysis |

## 🔄 Migration: product-manager Agent → /create-prd Command

### The Problem with product-manager Agent

**Original Agent**:
- 1,285 lines of instructions
- Hanging on execution
- Too many mandatory steps
- Over-engineered for simple task

**Streamlined Agent**:
- 243 lines (81% reduction)
- Still hanging occasionally
- Still slower than needed

**Root Cause**: Creating a PRD is a **template-based task** that doesn't need agent complexity.

### The Solution: /create-prd Slash Command

**New Slash Command**:
- ~200 lines of instructions
- Fast execution (no agent overhead)
- Predictable output
- Same quality PRD

**Why It Works Better**:
1. **No agent invocation overhead** - Direct execution
2. **Simpler context** - Just the template and instructions
3. **No hanging** - No complex tool orchestration
4. **Faster** - Executes in seconds, not minutes

## 📋 Current Slash Commands

### Planning & Requirements
- **`/create-prd`** - Create PRD from product brief
- **`/create-design-spec`** - Create frontend design specification (NEW!)

### Story Orchestration
- **`/implement-stories`** - Full automated workflow
- **`/next-story`** - Start next available story
- **`/review-story`** - Trigger code review
- **`/story-status`** - Show progress report

---

## 🤖 Current Agents

### Planning Agents
- ~~**product-manager**~~ → **Use `/create-prd` instead**
- **software-architect** - Create technical architecture
- **scrum-master** - Create user stories from PRD

### Design Agents
- ~~**frontend-design**~~ → **Use `/create-design-spec` instead**
- **v0-frontend-design** - Create design specs with v0.dev

### Development Agents
- **javascript-developer** - Implement JavaScript/TypeScript features
- **code-reviewer** - Review code for quality and standards

### Analysis Agents
- **planning-analyst** - Analyze and improve planning documents

## 💡 Recommendations for Other Agents

### Candidates for Slash Commands

#### 1. scrum-master (972 lines)
**Current**: Agent that creates user stories from PRD
**Potential**: `/create-stories` command
**Reason**: Template-based task, predictable output

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ **Keep as agent for now**
- Requires complex analysis of PRD
- Needs to understand dependencies
- Output varies significantly based on PRD complexity

#### 2. frontend-design (759 lines)
**Current**: Agent that creates design specifications
**Potential**: `/create-design-spec` command
**Reason**: Template-based, but requires research

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ **Keep as agent**
- Requires web-search for design trends
- Needs context7 for best practices
- Creative decisions required

#### 3. software-architect (647 lines)
**Current**: Agent that creates architecture documents
**Potential**: `/create-architecture` command
**Reason**: Template-based, but requires technical analysis

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ **Keep as agent**
- Requires deep technical analysis
- Needs context7 for framework best practices
- Complex decision-making required

#### 4. code-reviewer (501 lines)
**Current**: Agent that reviews code
**Potential**: `/review-code` command
**Reason**: Structured output, but requires analysis

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Could be slash command**
- Follows predictable review checklist
- Output is structured (pass/fail + feedback)
- Could be faster as command

#### 5. planning-analyst (544 lines)
**Current**: Agent that analyzes planning documents
**Potential**: `/analyze-plan` command
**Reason**: Structured analysis, predictable output

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Could be slash command**
- Follows analysis framework
- Predictable output format
- Could be faster as command

---

## 🎯 Action Items

### Completed
- ✅ Created `/create-prd` slash command
- ✅ Replaced product-manager agent usage

### Recommended Next Steps

#### High Priority
1. **Test `/create-prd`** - Verify it works well in practice
2. **Monitor performance** - Compare speed vs agent

#### Medium Priority
3. **Consider `/review-code`** - Could speed up code reviews
4. **Consider `/analyze-plan`** - Could speed up planning analysis

#### Low Priority
5. **Streamline remaining agents** - Keep under 500 lines
6. **Document best practices** - When to use each approach

## 📈 Expected Performance Improvements

### product-manager: Agent → Slash Command

| Metric | Agent (Streamlined) | Slash Command | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Lines of Context** | 243 | ~200 | 18% smaller |
| **Execution Time** | 2-5 minutes | 10-30 seconds | 80-90% faster |
| **Hanging Issues** | Occasional | None | 100% fixed |
| **Predictability** | Variable | Consistent | Much better |

## 🔍 How to Decide: Agent vs Slash Command

### Ask These Questions:

1. **Is the output template-based?**
   - Yes → Slash command
   - No → Agent

2. **Does it require research (context7, web-search)?**
   - Yes → Agent
   - No → Slash command

3. **Does it require complex decision-making?**
   - Yes → Agent
   - No → Slash command

4. **Is speed critical?**
   - Yes → Slash command
   - No → Either

5. **Does output vary significantly based on input?**
   - Yes → Agent
   - No → Slash command

### Example: product-manager

1. **Template-based?** ✅ Yes (PRD has standard structure)
2. **Requires research?** ⚠️ Optional (can be done manually)
3. **Complex decisions?** ❌ No (mostly filling in template)
4. **Speed critical?** ✅ Yes (want fast PRD creation)
5. **Output varies?** ❌ No (same 14 sections every time)

**Result**: ✅ **Perfect for slash command**

### Example: javascript-developer

1. **Template-based?** ❌ No (code varies greatly)
2. **Requires research?** ✅ Yes (context7 for libraries)
3. **Complex decisions?** ✅ Yes (architecture, patterns)
4. **Speed critical?** ⚠️ Somewhat (but quality matters more)
5. **Output varies?** ✅ Yes (every feature is different)

**Result**: ✅ **Keep as agent**
