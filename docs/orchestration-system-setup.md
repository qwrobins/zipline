# Story Orchestration System - Setup Complete! 🎉

The complete Story Orchestration System has been successfully created and is ready to use.

## ✅ What Was Created

### 1. Slash Commands (`.claude/commands/`)

Four powerful slash commands for orchestrating story implementation:

#### **`/implement-stories`** - Main Orchestration Workflow
- Full automated workflow from discovery to completion
- Analyzes stories, builds dependency graph, creates roadmap
- Coordinates dev agents and code reviews
- Handles feedback loops and tracks progress
- **File**: `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md`

#### **`/next-story`** - Continue with Next Story
- Identifies next story ready for implementation
- Starts work on it automatically
- Updates state files
- **File**: `.claude/commands/next-story.md`

#### **`/review-story [story-id]`** - Trigger Code Review
- Invokes code-reviewer agent for specific story
- Processes review results
- Handles approval or change requests
- **File**: `.claude/commands/review-story.md`

#### **`/story-status`** - Progress Report
- Comprehensive status report across all stories
- Shows completed, in-progress, blocked stories
- Provides actionable next steps
- **File**: `.claude/commands/story-status.md`

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### Step 1: Verify Installation

Check that slash commands are available:
```bash
# In Claude Code, type:
/

# You should see:
# - /implement-stories
# - /next-story
# - /review-story
# - /story-status
```

### Step 2: Create User Stories

Create story files in `docs/stories/`:

```bash
# Example story structure:
docs/stories/
├── 1.1-user-authentication.md
├── 1.2-user-profile.md
├── 1.3-password-reset.md
└── 1.4-admin-dashboard.md
```

**Story File Template**:
```markdown
# Story 1.1: User Authentication

**Status**: Not Started
**Dependencies**: None

## Description
Implement user authentication system with login, logout, and session management.

## Technology Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- PostgreSQL

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can register with email and password
2. Users can log in with credentials
3. Users can log out
4. Sessions are managed securely
5. All tests pass

## Files to Create/Modify
- `src/components/LoginForm.tsx`
- `src/api/auth.ts`
- `src/pages/login.tsx`
```

### Step 3: Initialize Orchestration

```bash
/implement-stories
```

This will:
1. Scan all stories in `docs/stories/`
2. Build dependency graph
3. Create roadmap
4. Start implementing stories in order

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

```bash
/story-status
```

Shows:
- Overall progress
- Completed stories
- In-progress stories
- Blocked stories
- Next actions

---

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Full Automated Workflow

```bash
# Start the orchestration
/implement-stories

# The system will:
# 1. Analyze all stories
# 2. Build dependency graph
# 3. Create roadmap
# 4. Start Story 1.1 (no dependencies)
# 5. Invoke @agent-javascript-developer
# 6. Wait for completion
# 7. Trigger code review
# 8. Process review results
# 9. Move to next story
# 10. Repeat until all done

# Check progress anytime
/story-status

# Pause if needed (press Escape)
# Resume later
/implement-stories
```

### Example 2: Manual Control

```bash
# Initialize and analyze only
/implement-stories
# Press Escape after analysis completes

# Check what's ready
/story-status

# Start next story manually
/next-story

# Wait for dev to complete...

# Trigger review manually
/review-story 1.1

# Continue with next
/next-story
```

### Example 3: Resume After Interruption

```bash
# Work was interrupted yesterday
# State files preserved everything

# Check current status
/story-status

# Output shows:
# - Story 1.1: Done ✅
# - Story 1.2: In Review 🔍
# - Story 1.3: Not Started (Ready)

# Continue where you left off
/next-story
# Starts Story 1.3
```

### Example 4: Handle Review Feedback

```bash
# Story 1.2 review found issues
/story-status

# Output shows:
# - Story 1.2: Changes Requested ⚠️
#   - 3 critical issues
#   - Review: docs/code_reviews/1.2-code-review.md

# Read the review
# Fix the issues
# Update story status to "Ready for Review"

# Re-trigger review
/review-story 1.2

# If approved, continues automatically
```
