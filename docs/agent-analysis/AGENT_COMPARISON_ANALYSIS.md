## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1 Keep from `agents/`

**Definitely Keep:**
1. ✅ **software-architect** - No equivalent in acca/, critical for workflow
2. ✅ **planning-analyst** - Unique md-tree integration, no equivalent
3. ✅ **javascript-developer** - Superior workflow integration and mandatory protocols
4. ✅ **product-manager** - Better for creating implementation-ready PRDs
5. ✅ **scrum-master** - Superior for creating orchestrator-ready user stories

**Why**: These agents form a cohesive workflow that's unique and valuable. The mandatory protocols (sequential_thinking, context7, iterative problem-solving) ensure higher quality output.

### 6.2 Adopt from `acca/`

**High Priority Additions:**
1. ✅ **react-specialist** - More React-specific than javascript-developer
2. ✅ **nextjs-developer** - Next.js 14+ specific expertise
3. ✅ **code-reviewer** - Comprehensive code review capabilities
4. ✅ **python-pro** - Python development (missing from agents/)
5. ✅ **devops-engineer** - DevOps and CI/CD (missing from agents/)
6. ✅ **multi-agent-coordinator** - For orchestrating multiple agents
7. ✅ **frontend-developer** - General frontend (React, Vue, Angular)
8. ✅ **backend-developer** - Server-side development

**Medium Priority:**
9. ⚠️ **typescript-pro** - TypeScript-specific expertise
10. ⚠️ **qa-expert** - Test automation specialist
11. ⚠️ **performance-engineer** - Performance optimization
12. ⚠️ **security-auditor** - Security vulnerability assessment

**Why**: These fill critical gaps in our current agent roster while maintaining the acca/ philosophy of modularity and broad coverage.

### 6.3 Merge Opportunities

**Consider Merging:**
1. **product-manager**: Merge business strategy aspects from acca/ into agents/ version
2. **scrum-master**: Add ceremony facilitation from acca/ to agents/ version
3. **javascript-developer**: Add ES2023+ features and performance optimization from acca/javascript-pro

**Approach**: Enhance agents/ versions with specific capabilities from acca/ while maintaining workflow integration.

### 6.4 Organizational Strategy

**Recommended Structure:**

```
agents/
├── 00-workflow/                    # Workflow-integrated agents (keep from agents/)
│   ├── product-manager.md
│   ├── software-architect.md
│   ├── planning-analyst.md
│   ├── scrum-master.md
│   └── javascript-developer.md
│
├── 01-development/                 # Development specialists (from acca/)
│   ├── frontend-developer.md
│   ├── backend-developer.md
│   ├── react-specialist.md
│   ├── nextjs-developer.md
│   ├── python-pro.md
│   └── typescript-pro.md
│
├── 02-quality/                     # Quality & testing (from acca/)
│   ├── code-reviewer.md
│   ├── qa-expert.md
│   ├── performance-engineer.md
│   └── security-auditor.md
│
├── 03-infrastructure/              # DevOps & infrastructure (from acca/)
│   ├── devops-engineer.md
│   ├── kubernetes-specialist.md
│   └── cloud-architect.md
│
└── 04-orchestration/               # Meta-orchestration (from acca/)
    └── multi-agent-coordinator.md
```

**Rationale**:
- Keep workflow agents separate and intact
- Add specialized agents from acca/ in organized categories
- Maintain clear separation between workflow-integrated and modular agents
- Enable both approaches to coexist

## 12. Conclusion

Both `agents/` and `acca/` directories offer valuable but different approaches to AI agent development:

**`agents/`** excels at:
- Workflow integration and orchestration
- Mandatory quality protocols
- Deep, comprehensive guidance
- Creating implementation-ready documentation

**`acca/`** excels at:
- Breadth of coverage across all domains
- Concise, scannable reference
- MCP tool integration
- Modular, flexible usage

**Recommendation**: **Keep both approaches** and organize them clearly. Use `agents/` for workflow-integrated development and `acca/` for specialized expertise and modular tasks. The combination provides the best of both worlds: deep workflow integration where needed, and broad specialized coverage for everything else.
