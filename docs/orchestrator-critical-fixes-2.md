# Orchestrator Critical Fixes - Part 2

## Three Critical Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Default Branch "main" Instead of "master" ‚úÖ
### Issue #2: Code Review Before Merge (CRITICAL) ‚úÖ
### Issue #3: Optimize Dependency Installation ‚úÖ

---

## Issue #1: Default Branch Should Be "main" Not "master"

### Problem
When the orchestrator initialized git in Phase 7, it created a repository with the default "master" branch. Modern best practice is to use "main" as the default branch name.

### Solution Applied

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Lines 506-534

**Added command after initial commit:**
```bash
# Set default branch to "main" (modern best practice)
git branch -M main
```

**Complete sequence:**
1. `git init`
2. Create `.gitignore`
3. `git add .`
4. `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
5. **`git branch -M main`** ‚Üê NEW
6. Verify initialization succeeded

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Follows modern Git best practices
- ‚úÖ Consistent with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket defaults
- ‚úÖ More inclusive terminology
- ‚úÖ Aligns with industry standards

## Issue #2: Developers Merging Before Code Review (CRITICAL)

### Problem
Developer agents were merging their changes into the main branch immediately after completing story implementation, BEFORE code review took place. This caused:
- Multiple code-review agents triggering builds simultaneously
- Untested/unreviewed code getting merged into main
- Violation of quality gate process

### Solution Applied

#### Part 1: Updated Developer Agent Invocation (Lines 640-707)

**REMOVED from initial implementation:**
- ‚ùå Step 10: Merge worktree
- ‚ùå Step 11: Cleanup worktree

**ADDED to initial implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Warning: "DO NOT MERGE OR CLEANUP - Code review happens FIRST"
- ‚úÖ Step 10: Update story status to "Ready for Review"
- ‚úÖ Step 11: Add Dev Agent Record
- ‚úÖ Step 12: STOP HERE - Do NOT merge or cleanup worktree
- ‚úÖ Instruction: "LEAVE THE WORKTREE INTACT"

**Added dependency optimization instructions:**
- Story 1.1: Install ALL core project dependencies
- Stories 1.2+: Check if dependencies exist before installing

#### Part 2: Enhanced Code Review Phase (Lines 724-767)

**Added to code review invocation:**
- ‚úÖ Note that changes are in worktree (NOT merged yet)
- ‚úÖ Instruction to review code BEFORE merge
- ‚úÖ Request for detailed assessment (Approved/Changes Requested/Rejected)
- ‚úÖ Categorization of issues (Critical/High/Medium/Low priority)

#### Part 3: NEW Phase 7 - Handle Review Outcomes and Merge (Lines 767-917)

**Created entirely new phase where developer agents are re-invoked after code review:**

**If Review APPROVED:**
1. Re-invoke developer agent with approval notification
2. Developer agent detects conflicts
3. Developer agent merges worktree (if no conflicts)
4. Developer agent unregisters files
5. Developer agent cleans up worktree
6. Developer agent updates story status to "Done"
7. Developer agent documents merge in Dev Agent Record
8. Orchestrator verifies merge completed
9. Orchestrator updates progress tracking

**If Review CHANGES REQUESTED:**
1. Re-invoke developer agent with review feedback
2. Developer agent reads review file
3. Developer agent switches to worktree
4. Developer agent implements fixes
5. Developer agent commits fixes
6. Developer agent updates status to "Ready for Review"
7. Orchestrator triggers another code review cycle
8. Process repeats until approved

**If Review REJECTED:**
1. Update task state to "blocked"
2. Escalate to user with rejection reason
3. Wait for user decision (re-scope/abandon/escalate)
4. Do NOT proceed to next wave

#### Part 4: NEW Phase 7a - Conflict Detection and Resolution (Lines 919-1014)

**Created new phase for handling merge conflicts:**

**For Low/Medium Severity Conflicts:**
- Invoke conflict-resolver agent
- Automatically apply proposed resolution
- Notify developer agent to retry merge

**For High/Critical Severity Conflicts:**
- Invoke conflict-resolver agent
- Present proposed resolution to user
- Wait for user decision
- Apply approved resolution
- Notify developer agent to retry merge

### New Workflow

```
1. Developer Agent: Implement story in worktree
   ‚Üì
2. Developer Agent: Commit changes
   ‚Üì
3. Developer Agent: Update status to "Ready for Review"
   ‚Üì
4. Developer Agent: STOP (leave worktree intact)
   ‚Üì
5. Orchestrator: Invoke code review agent
   ‚Üì
6. Code Review Agent: Review changes in worktree
   ‚Üì
7. Code Review Agent: Create review report
   ‚Üì
8. Code Review Agent: Return to orchestrator
   ‚Üì
9. Orchestrator: Read review results
   ‚Üì
10. IF APPROVED:
    ‚Üì
    Orchestrator: Re-invoke developer agent for merge
    ‚Üì
    Developer Agent: Detect conflicts
    ‚Üì
    Developer Agent: Merge worktree (if no conflicts)
    ‚Üì
    Developer Agent: Cleanup worktree
    ‚Üì
    Developer Agent: Update status to "Done"
    ‚Üì
    Orchestrator: Proceed to next wave
    
11. IF CHANGES REQUESTED:
    ‚Üì
    Orchestrator: Re-invoke developer agent with feedback
    ‚Üì
    Developer Agent: Implement fixes in worktree
    ‚Üì
    Developer Agent: Update status to "Ready for Review"
    ‚Üì
    Return to step 5 (code review)
```

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Code review happens BEFORE merge (quality gate enforced)
- ‚úÖ Only approved code gets merged to main
- ‚úÖ Worktrees stay intact during review process
- ‚úÖ Developer agents handle merge after approval
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns (implement ‚Üí review ‚Üí merge)
- ‚úÖ Prevents untested code from reaching main branch
- ‚úÖ Reduces build triggers (only on approved merges)

## Issue #3: Optimize Dependency Installation

### Problem
Each developer agent working in a separate worktree was installing the same project dependencies multiple times, wasting tokens and time.

### Solution Applied

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Lines 690-707

**Added to developer agent invocation:**

**For Story 1.1 (Project Initialization):**
```
**Project Dependencies (Story 1.1 ONLY):**
- If this is Story 1.1 (Project Initialization), install ALL core project dependencies
- Include: package managers, frameworks, testing libraries, linting tools, etc.
- Commit package.json and lock files to enable efficient dependency installation in later stories
- Document all installed dependencies in the Dev Agent Record
```

**For Stories 1.2+ (Subsequent Stories):**
```
**Project Dependencies (Stories 1.2+):**
- Check if dependencies already exist in package.json/lock file before installing
- If dependencies exist, run install command (npm install, pip install -r, etc.)
- Only add new dependencies if they are NOT already in the lock file
- This saves tokens and ensures consistent dependency versions
```

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed once in Story 1.1
- ‚úÖ Subsequent stories use lock file (faster, consistent)
- ‚úÖ Saves tokens (no repeated dependency resolution)
- ‚úÖ Ensures consistent dependency versions across all stories
- ‚úÖ Reduces worktree setup time
- ‚úÖ Better dependency management
