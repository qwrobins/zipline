## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. Faster Execution
**Before**: Agent would hang trying to process 1,285 lines of instructions
**After**: Agent processes 243 lines quickly and executes efficiently

### 2. Clearer Instructions
**Before**: Multiple sections with overlapping instructions
**After**: Single, clear workflow with 3 steps

### 3. Focused Workflow
**Before**:
```
Step 1: Analyze (with 10+ sub-steps)
Step 2: Research (with extensive examples)
Step 3: Structure (with multiple variations)
Step 4: Create (with templates)
Step 5: Validate (with self-assessment)
Step 6: Save (with multiple checks)
```

**After**:
```
Step 1: Analyze Requirements (use sequential_thinking)
Step 2: Research Best Practices (use context7)
Step 3: Create PRD (use save-file)
```

### 4. Maintained Quality
- Still requires sequential_thinking
- Still requires context7 research
- Still produces comprehensive PRDs
- Still includes all essential sections

---

## 📋 PRD Structure (Unchanged)

1. Executive Summary
2. Problem Statement
3. Goals & Objectives
4. Target Users
5. Scope (In/Out)
6. Functional Requirements
7. Non-Functional Requirements
8. User Stories & Epics
9. Technical Assumptions
10. Dependencies
11. Risks
12. Success Metrics
13. Timeline (Optional)
14. Next Steps
