# Agent Integration Implementation Roadmap

**Goal**: Integrate the best agents from both `agents/` and `acca/` directories into a unified, well-organized ecosystem.

**Timeline**: 4 weeks to initial integration, ongoing expansion

**Note**: The `agents/` directory has been reorganized with the following structure:
- `agents/definitions/` - Agent definition files
- `agents/guides/` - User guides and documentation
- `agents/conventions/` - Standards and conventions

---

## Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Preserve Existing Workflow

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ **No changes to agents/definitions/** - Keep all 5 workflow-integrated agents intact
2. ✅ **Create backup** - Copy current agents/ to agents.backup/
3. ✅ **Document current state** - Ensure all workflow documentation is up-to-date

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] agents.backup/ directory created
- [ ] Current workflow documented
- [ ] All agents/definitions/ agents tested and working

**Commands**:
```bash
# Backup current agents
cp -r agents agents.backup

# Verify all agents work
ls -la agents/definitions/*.md
```

---

### Day 3-5: Add Tier 1 Critical Agents from acca/

**Priority Agents** (5 agents):

4. **code-reviewer** - Comprehensive code review
5. **nextjs-developer** - Next.js 14+ specialist

**Tasks**:
1. Copy agents from acca/ to agents/definitions/
2. Test each agent individually
3. Document usage patterns
4. Create quick reference guide

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] 5 new agents added to agents/definitions/
- [ ] Each agent tested with sample tasks
- [ ] Usage guide created for each
