# Git Worktree Multi-Agent Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a git worktree-based workflow system that enables multiple AI agents to work on the same codebase simultaneously without conflicts.

**Implementation Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Tested  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Problem Statement

When multiple AI agents (2-3) work on the same codebase concurrently, they create conflicts:
- File modification conflicts
- Test execution interference
- Build process contention
- Merge conflicts and coordination issues

**Previous Solution:** Sequential execution (slow)  
**New Solution:** Git worktree isolation (fast, parallel)

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Git Worktree Manager** (`agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh`)
   - Shell script for managing worktree lifecycle
   - Creates, merges, and cleans up worktrees
   - Tracks active worktrees in registry
   - Handles error cases and edge conditions

2. **Workflow Directive** (`agents/directives/git-worktree-workflow.md`)
   - Mandatory workflow for all development agents
   - Step-by-step instructions for agents
   - Error handling procedures
   - Best practices and troubleshooting

3. **Agent Integration**
   - Updated all development agent definitions
   - Added mandatory worktree workflow requirement
   - Integrated into agent workflow steps

4. **Orchestration Integration** (`.claude/commands/implement-stories.md`)
   - Coordinates worktree creation for multiple agents
   - Tracks active worktrees
   - Manages cleanup and error handling

5. **Cleanup Command** (`.claude/commands/cleanup-worktrees.md`)
   - List active worktrees
   - Auto-cleanup abandoned worktrees
   - Manual cleanup options
   - Force cleanup for emergencies

### Worktree Registry

Location: `.agent-orchestration/worktree-registry.json`

Structure:
```json
{
  "worktrees": [
    {
      "branch": "agent-javascript-developer-1-1-20240107-120000",
      "story_id": "1.1",
      "agent_name": "javascript-developer",
      "path": ".worktrees/agent-javascript-developer-1-1-20240107-120000",
      "created_at": "2024-01-07T12:00:00Z",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workflow

### Pre-Work Setup

1. **Verify Git Initialization**
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --git-dir
   ```

2. **Create Worktree**
   ```bash
   ./agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "<story-id>" "<agent-name>"
   ```

3. **Switch to Worktree**
   ```bash
   cd .worktrees/agent-<agent-name>-<story-id>-<timestamp>
   ```

### During Work

4. **Work in Isolation**
   - All file modifications in worktree
   - Regular commits
   - Run tests in worktree
   - Update story status

### Post-Work Integration

5. **Return to Repo Root**
   ```bash
   cd ../../
   ```

6. **Merge Changes**
   ```bash
   ./agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh merge "<worktree-path>"
   ```

7. **Cleanup Worktree**
   ```bash
   ./agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh cleanup "<worktree-path>"
   ```

## Features

### Automatic Features

- ✅ Unique branch name generation with timestamps
- ✅ Worktree registry tracking
- ✅ Conflict detection and reporting
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of abandoned worktrees (24h+)
- ✅ Color-coded output for clarity
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

### Manual Features

- ✅ List active worktrees
- ✅ Cleanup specific worktree
- ✅ Force cleanup all worktrees
- ✅ Manual conflict resolution

## Error Handling

### Git Not Initialized
- **Detection:** `git rev-parse --git-dir` fails
- **Action:** Stop and report error to user
- **Message:** "Git repository not initialized. Please run 'git init' first."

### Worktree Creation Fails
- **Detection:** `git worktree add` fails
- **Action:** Report error with details
- **Common causes:** Disk space, permissions, corrupted repo

### Merge Conflicts
- **Detection:** `git merge` fails with conflicts
- **Action:** Report conflicting files to user
- **Resolution:** Manual conflict resolution required

### Uncommitted Changes
- **Detection:** `git diff-index` shows changes
- **Action:** Prevent merge, request commit
- **Resolution:** Commit changes before merging

### Abandoned Worktrees
- **Detection:** Worktree older than 24 hours
- **Action:** Auto-cleanup via cleanup-abandoned command
- **Prevention:** Regular cleanup runs

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Create Worktree
```bash
$ ./agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "test-story-1.1" "test-agent"
[SUCCESS] Worktree created successfully
.worktrees/agent-test-agent-test-story-1-1-20251007-120318
```
✅ **PASSED**

### Test 2: List Worktrees
```bash
$ ./agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh list
[INFO] Active worktrees:
/path/to/repo/.worktrees/agent-test-agent-test-story-1-1-20251007-120318
[INFO] Registry information:
  Story: test-story-1.1 | Agent: test-agent | ...
```
✅ **PASSED**

### Test 3: Make Changes in Worktree
```bash
$ cd .worktrees/agent-test-agent-test-story-1-1-20251007-120318
$ echo "# Test File" > test-worktree.md
$ git add test-worktree.md
$ git commit -m "Test worktree functionality"
```
✅ **PASSED**

### Test 4: Merge Worktree
```bash
$ ./agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh merge ".worktrees/agent-test-agent-test-story-1-1-20251007-120318"
[SUCCESS] Merge completed successfully
```
✅ **PASSED**

### Test 5: Cleanup Worktree
```bash
$ ./agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh cleanup ".worktrees/agent-test-agent-test-story-1-1-20251007-120318"
[SUCCESS] Cleanup completed
```
✅ **PASSED**

### Test 6: Verify Cleanup
```bash
$ ./agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh list
[INFO] Active worktrees:
/path/to/repo  [main]
[INFO] Registry information:
(empty)
```
✅ **PASSED**

## Performance Metrics

- **Worktree Creation:** ~1-2 seconds
- **Merge Operation:** ~2-5 seconds (depends on changes)
- **Cleanup Operation:** ~1-2 seconds
- **Abandoned Cleanup:** ~5-10 seconds (depends on count)

## Benefits

### Speed Improvement

**Without Worktrees (Sequential):**
```
Story 1.1 (4h) → Story 1.2 (4h) → Story 1.3 (4h) = 12 hours total
```

**With Worktrees (Parallel):**
```
Story 1.1 (4h) ┐
Story 1.2 (4h) ├─ All simultaneous = 4 hours total
Story 1.3 (4h) ┘
```

**Speedup:** 3x faster (with 3 agents)

### Conflict Prevention

- ✅ No file locking issues
- ✅ No test interference
- ✅ No build conflicts
- ✅ Clean merge history
- ✅ Easy rollback

## Requirements

### System Requirements

- Git 2.5+ (for worktree support)
- Bash 4.0+
- jq (for JSON processing)
- Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, Git Bash on Windows)

### Installation

WORKTREE_2=$(./agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "1.2" "python-developer")
WORKTREE_3=$(./agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "1.3" "rust-developer")

# Assign to agents
# Agent 1 → Story 1.1, Worktree: $WORKTREE_1
# Agent 2 → Story 1.2, Worktree: $WORKTREE_2
# Agent 3 → Story 1.3, Worktree: $WORKTREE_3
