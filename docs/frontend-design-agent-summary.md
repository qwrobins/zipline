# Frontend Design Agent (Non-v0) - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully created a new **frontend-design** agent that specializes in creating comprehensive frontend design specifications WITHOUT using v0.dev. This agent follows the same methodology as the v0-frontend-design agent but relies on research, industry standards, and detailed documentation instead of AI-generated design artifacts.

---

## 📦 Deliverable

### New Agent: frontend-design ✅
**File**: `agents/definitions/frontend-design.md`

**Purpose**: Creates design specifications through research and documentation (NOT implementation, NOT v0.dev)

**Key Features**:
- Creates comprehensive design specification documents
- Defines design systems (tokens, colors, typography, spacing)
- Documents component specifications with all states and variants
- Specifies WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility requirements
- Creates responsive design specifications
- Maps user flows and interaction patterns
- Provides developer handoff documentation
- Research-based design decisions using context7

**Output**: `docs/design/frontend-design-spec.md` - Comprehensive design specification document

**Critical Constraint**: NEVER writes implementation code - only design documentation
