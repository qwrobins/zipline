# Orchestrator Workflow: Before vs. After Comparison

## Issue #1: Default Branch Name

### ‚ùå BEFORE
```bash
git init
# Creates repository with "master" branch (outdated)
```

### ‚úÖ AFTER
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main  # ‚Üê NEW: Sets default branch to "main"
```

**Impact:** Modern Git best practice, consistent with industry standards

---

## Issue #2: Code Review Workflow (CRITICAL)

### ‚ùå BEFORE

**Developer Agent Steps:**
```
1. Implement story in worktree
2. Commit changes
3. Update status to "Ready for Review"
4. Merge worktree ‚Üê WRONG: Merging before code review!
5. Cleanup worktree
6. Return to orchestrator
```

**Orchestrator Steps:**
```
1. Wait for developer to complete
2. Invoke code review agent
3. Code review happens AFTER merge ‚Üê WRONG: Too late!
4. If issues found, code already in main ‚Üê PROBLEM!
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Untested code merged to main
- ‚ùå Code review happens after merge (too late)
- ‚ùå Multiple agents trigger builds simultaneously
- ‚ùå Quality gate violated

### ‚úÖ AFTER

**Developer Agent Steps (Initial Implementation):**
```
1. Implement story in worktree
2. Commit changes
3. Update status to "Ready for Review"
4. Add Dev Agent Record
5. STOP HERE ‚Üê NEW: Do NOT merge!
6. Leave worktree intact ‚Üê NEW: Keep for code review
7. Return to orchestrator
```

**Orchestrator Steps:**
```
1. Wait for ALL developers in wave to complete
2. Invoke code review agent for each story
3. Code review happens BEFORE merge ‚Üê CORRECT!
4. Read review results
5. Handle review outcomes:
   
   IF APPROVED:
     - Re-invoke developer agent for merge
     - Developer merges worktree
     - Developer cleans up worktree
     - Status: "Done"
   
   IF CHANGES REQUESTED:
     - Re-invoke developer agent with feedback
     - Developer implements fixes in worktree
     - Status: "Ready for Review"
     - Repeat code review
   
   IF REJECTED:
     - Escalate to user
     - Wait for decision
```

**Developer Agent Steps (After Approval):**
```
1. Receive approval notification
2. Detect potential conflicts
3. Merge worktree to main ‚Üê NEW: Only after approval!
4. Unregister files
5. Cleanup worktree
6. Update status to "Done"
7. Document merge in Dev Agent Record
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Code review before merge (quality gate enforced)
- ‚úÖ Only approved code reaches main
- ‚úÖ Worktrees stay intact during review
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Proper feedback loop for fixes

## Issue #3: Dependency Management

### ‚ùå BEFORE

**Story 1.1 (Project Initialization):**
```
Developer Agent:
1. Create project structure
2. Install some dependencies
3. Maybe commit package.json
```

**Story 1.2 (API Client):**
```
Developer Agent:
1. Switch to worktree
2. Install axios (resolves dependencies from scratch)
3. Install jest (resolves dependencies from scratch)
4. Install eslint (resolves dependencies from scratch)
5. Implement story
```

**Story 1.3 (UI Setup):**
```
Developer Agent:
1. Switch to worktree
2. Install react (resolves dependencies from scratch)
3. Install jest (again! resolves dependencies from scratch)
4. Install eslint (again! resolves dependencies from scratch)
5. Implement story
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Dependencies installed multiple times
- ‚ùå Dependency resolution happens repeatedly
- ‚ùå Wastes tokens on repeated npm/pip operations
- ‚ùå Inconsistent dependency versions possible
- ‚ùå Slower worktree setup

### ‚úÖ AFTER

**Story 1.1 (Project Initialization):**
```
Developer Agent:
1. Create project structure
2. Install ALL core dependencies: ‚Üê NEW: Install everything!
   - Package managers (npm, yarn, pip, etc.)
   - Frameworks (NestJS, React, etc.)
   - Testing libraries (Jest, Pytest, etc.)
   - Linting tools (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
   - All other core dependencies
3. Commit package.json AND lock file ‚Üê NEW: Lock versions!
4. Document all installed dependencies
```

**Story 1.2 (API Client):**
```
Developer Agent:
1. Switch to worktree
2. Check package.json ‚Üê NEW: Dependencies already there!
3. Run: npm install ‚Üê NEW: Install from lock file (fast!)
4. Only add NEW dependencies if needed
5. Implement story
```

**Story 1.3 (UI Setup):**
```
Developer Agent:
1. Switch to worktree
2. Check package.json ‚Üê NEW: Dependencies already there!
3. Run: npm install ‚Üê NEW: Install from lock file (fast!)
4. Only add NEW dependencies if needed
5. Implement story
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed once in Story 1.1
- ‚úÖ Subsequent stories use lock file (faster)
- ‚úÖ Saves tokens (no repeated dependency resolution)
- ‚úÖ Consistent dependency versions across all stories
- ‚úÖ Faster worktree setup

## Complete Workflow Comparison

### ‚ùå BEFORE (Problematic Workflow)

```
Wave 1: Stories 1.1, 1.2

Story 1.1:
  Developer: Implement ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Cleanup ‚Üí Done
  Orchestrator: Invoke Code Review
  Code Review: Review merged code (too late!)

Story 1.2:
  Developer: Implement ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Cleanup ‚Üí Done
  Orchestrator: Invoke Code Review
  Code Review: Review merged code (too late!)

Problems:
- Both stories merged before code review
- Both code reviews happen simultaneously
- Both trigger builds simultaneously
- If issues found, code already in main
- No way to fix without reverting commits
```

### ‚úÖ AFTER (Correct Workflow)

```
Wave 1: Stories 1.1, 1.2

Story 1.1:
  Developer: Implement ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Ready for Review ‚Üí STOP
  (Worktree intact, not merged)

Story 1.2:
  Developer: Implement ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí Ready for Review ‚Üí STOP
  (Worktree intact, not merged)

Orchestrator: Wait for both stories to be ready

Code Review Phase:
  Orchestrator: Invoke Code Review for 1.1
  Orchestrator: Invoke Code Review for 1.2
  Code Review 1.1: Review in worktree ‚Üí APPROVED
  Code Review 1.2: Review in worktree ‚Üí CHANGES REQUESTED

Handle Review Outcomes:
  Story 1.1 (APPROVED):
    Orchestrator: Re-invoke Developer for merge
    Developer: Merge ‚Üí Cleanup ‚Üí Done
  
  Story 1.2 (CHANGES REQUESTED):
    Orchestrator: Re-invoke Developer with feedback
    Developer: Fix issues ‚Üí Ready for Review
    Orchestrator: Invoke Code Review again
    Code Review: Review fixes ‚Üí APPROVED
    Orchestrator: Re-invoke Developer for merge
    Developer: Merge ‚Üí Cleanup ‚Üí Done

Benefits:
- Code review before merge (quality gate)
- Only approved code reaches main
- Clear feedback loop for fixes
- One build trigger per approved merge
- No untested code in main
```

## Metrics Comparison

### Time to Complete Wave (2 stories, 1 needs fixes)

**‚ùå BEFORE:**
```
Story 1.1: Implement (4h) + Merge (instant) = 4h
Story 1.2: Implement (4h) + Merge (instant) = 4h
Parallel execution: 4h total

Code Review (after merge):
  Review 1.1: 30min ‚Üí APPROVED (but already merged)
  Review 1.2: 30min ‚Üí CHANGES REQUESTED (but already merged!)
  
Fix Story 1.2:
  Revert commit: 15min
  Fix issues: 2h
  Re-merge: instant
  Re-review: 30min
  
Total: 4h + 30min + 2h 45min = 7h 15min
Plus: Untested code was in main for 30min
```

**‚úÖ AFTER:**
```
Story 1.1: Implement (4h) + Ready for Review = 4h
Story 1.2: Implement (4h) + Ready for Review = 4h
Parallel execution: 4h total

Code Review (before merge):
  Review 1.1: 30min ‚Üí APPROVED
  Review 1.2: 30min ‚Üí CHANGES REQUESTED
  Parallel reviews: 30min total

Merge Story 1.1:
  Developer merges: 5min
  
Fix Story 1.2:
  Fix issues in worktree: 2h
  Re-review: 30min ‚Üí APPROVED
  Developer merges: 5min
  
Total: 4h + 30min + 2h 35min = 7h 5min
Plus: Only approved code ever reached main
```

**Improvement:**
- ‚úÖ 10 minutes faster
- ‚úÖ No untested code in main
- ‚úÖ No commit reverts needed
- ‚úÖ Cleaner git history

### Token Usage (3 stories with dependencies)

**‚ùå BEFORE:**
```
Story 1.1: Install some deps (500 tokens)
Story 1.2: Install deps from scratch (800 tokens)
Story 1.3: Install deps from scratch (800 tokens)

Total: 2,100 tokens
```

**‚úÖ AFTER:**
```
Story 1.1: Install ALL deps + commit lock file (1,000 tokens)
Story 1.2: Install from lock file (200 tokens)
Story 1.3: Install from lock file (200 tokens)

Total: 1,400 tokens
Savings: 700 tokens (33% reduction)
```
