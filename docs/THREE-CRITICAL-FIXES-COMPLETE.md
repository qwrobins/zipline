# ✅ THREE CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETE

## Executive Summary

Three critical issues with the orchestrator's git workflow and dependency management have been successfully fixed:

1. ✅ **Default Branch "main"** - Modern Git best practice
2. ✅ **Code Review Before Merge** - Quality gate enforcement (CRITICAL)
3. ✅ **Dependency Optimization** - Install once, reuse everywhere

**Status:** All fixes applied and ready for testing

---

## Issue #1: Default Branch "main" ✅

### Problem
Git initialization created "master" branch instead of modern "main" branch.

### Fix Applied
Added `git branch -M main` after initial commit in git initialization sequence.

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Line 529

### Impact
- ✅ Follows modern Git best practices
- ✅ Consistent with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket defaults
- ✅ More inclusive terminology

---

## Issue #2: Code Review Before Merge ✅ (CRITICAL)

### Problem
Developer agents were merging changes BEFORE code review, causing:
- Untested code in main branch
- Multiple simultaneous build triggers
- Quality gate violations

### Fix Applied

#### Part 1: Developer Agent Initial Implementation
**Removed:**
- ❌ Merge worktree step
- ❌ Cleanup worktree step

**Added:**
- ✅ "DO NOT MERGE" warnings
- ✅ "STOP HERE" instruction
- ✅ "Leave worktree intact" requirement

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Lines 640-707

#### Part 2: Enhanced Code Review Phase
**Added:**
- ✅ Note that changes are in worktree (not merged)
- ✅ Review happens before merge
- ✅ Detailed assessment categories

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Lines 724-767

#### Part 3: NEW Phase 7 - Handle Review Outcomes and Merge
**Created entirely new phase:**
- ✅ Developer agents re-invoked after code review
- ✅ Merge only happens after approval
- ✅ Separate handling for Approved/Changes Requested/Rejected
- ✅ Conflict detection integrated into merge phase

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Lines 767-917

#### Part 4: NEW Phase 7a - Conflict Detection and Resolution
**Created new phase:**
- ✅ Automatic resolution for low/medium severity conflicts
- ✅ User approval for high/critical severity conflicts
- ✅ Retry mechanism after conflict resolution

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Lines 919-1014

### New Workflow

```
Developer: Implement → Commit → Ready for Review → STOP
    ↓
Orchestrator: Invoke Code Review
    ↓
Code Review: Review → Create Report → Return Result
    ↓
Orchestrator: Read Review Result
    ↓
IF APPROVED:
    Orchestrator: Re-invoke Developer for Merge
    Developer: Detect Conflicts → Merge → Cleanup → Done
    ↓
    Proceed to Next Wave

IF CHANGES REQUESTED:
    Orchestrator: Re-invoke Developer with Feedback
    Developer: Fix Issues → Ready for Review
    ↓
    Repeat Code Review

IF REJECTED:
    Orchestrator: Escalate to User
    User: Decide (Re-scope/Abandon/Manual Review)
```

### Impact
- ✅ Quality gate enforced (code review before merge)
- ✅ Only approved code reaches main branch
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Prevents untested code from reaching main
- ✅ Reduces build triggers (only on approved merges)

---

## Issue #3: Dependency Optimization ✅

### Problem
Each developer agent was installing the same dependencies multiple times, wasting tokens and time.

### Fix Applied

**For Story 1.1 (Project Initialization):**
- Install ALL core project dependencies
- Commit package.json and lock files
- Document installed dependencies

**For Stories 1.2+ (Subsequent Stories):**
- Check if dependencies exist in lock file
- Run install command (not add command)
- Only add new dependencies if not in lock file

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Lines 690-707

### Impact
- ✅ Dependencies installed once in Story 1.1
- ✅ Subsequent stories use lock file (faster)
- ✅ Saves tokens (no repeated dependency resolution)
- ✅ Ensures consistent dependency versions
- ✅ Reduces worktree setup time

## Verification Checklist

### Issue #1: Default Branch "main"
- [ ] Run orchestrator on project without git
- [ ] Verify git initialization creates "main" branch
- [ ] Check with: `git branch --show-current` (should show "main")
- [ ] Verify worktrees created from "main" branch

### Issue #2: Code Review Before Merge
- [ ] Developer agents do NOT merge after implementation
- [ ] Worktrees remain intact after implementation
- [ ] Code review happens before merge
- [ ] Developer agents re-invoked after code review
- [ ] Merge happens only after approval
- [ ] Changes requested triggers fix cycle
- [ ] Rejected reviews escalate to user
- [ ] Conflicts detected and resolved during merge

### Issue #3: Dependency Optimization
- [ ] Story 1.1 installs all core dependencies
- [ ] package.json and lock file committed in Story 1.1
- [ ] Stories 1.2+ check for existing dependencies
- [ ] Stories 1.2+ use install command (not add)
- [ ] Consistent dependency versions across stories

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Projects

If you have projects already using the orchestrator:

1. **Git Branch:**
   - Existing projects with "master" branch will continue to work
   - New projects will use "main" branch
   - To migrate existing project: `git branch -M main`

2. **Code Review Workflow:**
   - Existing worktrees should be cleaned up before using new workflow
   - New workflow will prevent premature merges
   - Review all in-progress stories before migration

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Existing projects with dependencies will continue to work
   - New projects will benefit from optimized dependency installation
   - Consider consolidating dependencies in next Story 1.1 equivalent

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All fixes applied to `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md`
2. ✅ Documentation created
3. ⏭️ Test with new project (git initialization with "main" branch)
4. ⏭️ Test code review workflow (verify merge happens after approval)
5. ⏭️ Test dependency optimization (verify Story 1.1 installs all deps)
6. ⏭️ Test conflict resolution (verify conflicts detected and resolved)
7. ⏭️ Update any related documentation if needed

---

## Conclusion
