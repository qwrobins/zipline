# Orchestrator Git Initialization Fix

## Critical Issue Fixed

**Problem:** The orchestrator was skipping the git worktree workflow when it detected that git was not initialized in the project, and proceeding directly to story implementation. This caused conflicts and workflow failures.

**Impact:**
- Multiple agents working directly in main repository without isolation
- Merge conflicts between parallel agents
- Loss of work due to conflicting changes
- Workflow failures and errors

## Root Cause

The orchestrator was treating git initialization as optional and asking the user what to do instead of:
1. Automatically initializing git if missing
2. Enforcing the MANDATORY worktree workflow for ALL story implementations

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Git Initialization Check in Phase 7

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Lines 489-590

**New Behavior:**

#### Step 1: Check Git Status (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
```bash
git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
```
- If succeeds ‚Üí Git is initialized, proceed to worktree workflow
- If fails ‚Üí Git is NOT initialized, proceed to automatic initialization

#### Step 2: Initialize Git if Missing (MANDATORY)
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Create .gitignore if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -f .gitignore ]; then
  cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
node_modules/
.env
.env.local
dist/
build/
.DS_Store
*.log
.agent-orchestration/
.worktrees/
EOF
fi

# Create initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Verify initialization succeeded
git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
```

#### Step 3: Enforce Worktree Workflow (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)
- The git worktree workflow is MANDATORY for ALL story implementations
- There are NO exceptions to using git worktrees
- Even if git was just initialized, worktrees MUST be used
- NEVER proceed with story implementation without worktrees
- NEVER work directly in the main repository

### 2. Added Error Handling

**If git init fails:**
- STOP and report: "Failed to initialize git repository. Please check git installation."

**If initial commit fails:**
- STOP and report: "Failed to create initial commit. Please check file permissions."

**If verification fails:**
- STOP and report: "Git initialization verification failed. Please initialize git manually."

**After successful initialization:**
- Report to user: "‚úÖ Git repository initialized successfully. Proceeding with worktree workflow."

### 3. Added Pre-Wave Verification

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Lines 592-607

**Before launching ANY agents, verify git is initialized:**

```bash
# Verify git is initialized
if ! git rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "ERROR: Git is not initialized. This should have been caught in Phase 7 initialization."
  echo "Please ensure git is initialized before proceeding."
  exit 1
fi
```

**If verification fails:**
- STOP immediately
- Report: "CRITICAL ERROR: Git not initialized. Cannot proceed with worktree workflow."
- Do NOT attempt to launch any agents
- Return to Phase 7 git initialization step

### 4. Enhanced Worktree Creation with Verification

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Lines 608-636

**Create worktree with verification:**

```bash
WORKTREE_PATH=$(./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "{story_id}" "{assigned_agent}")

# Verify worktree creation succeeded
if [ -z "$WORKTREE_PATH" ] || [ ! -d "$WORKTREE_PATH" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Failed to create worktree for story {story_id}"
  echo "Worktree workflow is MANDATORY. Cannot proceed without it."
  exit 1
fi
```

**If worktree creation fails:**
- STOP and report the error to the user
- Do NOT attempt to work without worktrees
- Provide troubleshooting guidance

### 5. Updated Agent Invocation Message

**Location:** `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Lines 637-668

**Enhanced message to agents:**

```
üö® CRITICAL: Git worktree workflow is MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS üö®

Git has been initialized and your isolated worktree has been created at: {worktree_path}

‚ö†Ô∏è YOU MUST work in the worktree - NEVER work directly in the main repository.
‚ö†Ô∏è The worktree workflow is REQUIRED for conflict prevention.
‚ö†Ô∏è There are NO exceptions to this requirement.

Follow these steps EXACTLY:
1. Design Planning
2. Reference Analysis
3. **Switch to worktree** (MANDATORY): cd {worktree_path}
4. **Verify you're in worktree**: pwd (should show .worktrees/agent-...)
5. Design-First Implementation
6. Progressive Validation
7. Commit all changes
8. Return to repo root: cd ../../
9. Design Quality Gate
10. **Merge worktree**: ./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh merge "{worktree_path}"
11. **Cleanup worktree**: ./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh cleanup "{worktree_path}"

**If you encounter ANY issues with the worktree workflow:**
- STOP immediately
- Report the error to the orchestrator
- Do NOT attempt to work without the worktree
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario 1: Git Already Initialized

```
1. Check git status ‚Üí Git is initialized ‚úÖ
2. Proceed directly to worktree workflow
3. Create worktree for story
4. Launch agent in isolated worktree
5. Agent works in worktree
6. Merge and cleanup worktree
```

### Scenario 2: Git Not Initialized

```
1. Check git status ‚Üí Git is NOT initialized ‚ùå
2. Initialize git repository automatically
3. Create .gitignore file
4. Create initial commit
5. Verify initialization succeeded ‚úÖ
6. Report success to user
7. Proceed to worktree workflow (MANDATORY)
8. Create worktree for story
9. Launch agent in isolated worktree
10. Agent works in worktree
11. Merge and cleanup worktree
```

### Scenario 3: Git Initialization Fails

```
1. Check git status ‚Üí Git is NOT initialized ‚ùå
2. Attempt to initialize git repository
3. Initialization fails ‚ùå
4. STOP immediately
5. Report error to user: "Failed to initialize git repository. Please check git installation."
6. Do NOT proceed with story implementation
7. Do NOT attempt to work without worktrees
```

## Verification Checklist

After this fix, verify the following behavior:

- [ ] Orchestrator checks git status before ANY story implementation
- [ ] If git is not initialized, orchestrator automatically initializes it
- [ ] Git initialization includes creating .gitignore and initial commit
- [ ] Orchestrator verifies git initialization succeeded
- [ ] Orchestrator NEVER skips worktree workflow
- [ ] Orchestrator NEVER asks user what to do about missing git
- [ ] Orchestrator STOPS if git initialization fails
- [ ] Orchestrator STOPS if worktree creation fails
- [ ] Agents receive clear instructions about MANDATORY worktree usage
- [ ] Agents are told to STOP if worktree workflow fails

## Error Messages

### Git Not Installed
```
ERROR: Failed to initialize git repository. Please check git installation.

Troubleshooting:
1. Verify git is installed: git --version
2. Install git if missing
3. Retry story implementation
```

### Git Init Failed
```
ERROR: Failed to create initial commit. Please check file permissions.

Troubleshooting:
1. Check file permissions in project directory
2. Ensure you have write access
3. Check for .git directory conflicts
4. Retry story implementation
```

### Worktree Creation Failed
```
ERROR: Failed to create worktree for story {story_id}
Worktree workflow is MANDATORY. Cannot proceed without it.

Troubleshooting:
1. Check git repository is initialized
2. Verify .worktrees directory is writable
3. Check for existing worktrees with same name
4. Review git worktree manager logs
```

## Benefits

### Automatic Git Initialization
- No manual intervention required
- Consistent git setup across all projects
- Proper .gitignore configuration from the start
- Clean initial commit

### Enforced Worktree Workflow
- MANDATORY worktree usage prevents conflicts
- No exceptions - even for newly initialized repos
- Clear error messages when workflow fails
- Agents cannot bypass worktree requirement

### Improved Reliability
- No more "git not initialized" errors during implementation
- No more conflicts from agents working in main repo
- Consistent workflow across all projects
- Better error handling and recovery
