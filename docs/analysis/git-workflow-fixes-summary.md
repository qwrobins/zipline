# Git Workflow Violations - Fixes Summary

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

Successfully identified and fixed **4 critical git workflow violations** that were causing:
- Story files being modified on main branch
- Uncommitted changes blocking merges
- Merge conflicts in parallel development
- Path resolution failures

All fixes are now **PRODUCTION READY** and committed.

---

## ‚úÖ Issue #1: Code-Reviewer Modifying Story Files on Main Branch

### **Problem**
Code-reviewer was updating story files (adding review summaries) directly on the main branch instead of in the worktree where the story was implemented.

### **Evidence from Production Logs**
```
Already on 'main'
M  docs/stories/0.0.project-initialization.md
M  docs/stories/0.1.design-system-setup.md
M  docs/stories/1.1.display-current-time.md
```

### **Root Cause**
- Code-reviewer invoked via `/review-story` command
- Command did NOT change directory to worktree
- Code-reviewer operated in main repo directory
- All file modifications happened on main branch

### **Fix Applied**

**File**: `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`

**Added Step 6.5: Verify Worktree Context (MANDATORY)**
- Verifies current branch is NOT "main"
- Verifies pwd is in `.worktrees/agent-*` directory
- Aborts with clear error if not in worktree context

**Enhanced Step 7: Save Review Report**
- Step 7.4: Commit all changes in worktree (MANDATORY)
- Step 7.5: Verify commit succeeded
- All review reports and story updates now committed in worktree branch

### **Result**
‚úÖ Code-reviewer can no longer modify files on main branch
‚úÖ All review changes committed in worktree before merge
‚úÖ Clear error message if invoked from wrong context

---

## ‚úÖ Issue #2: Uncommitted Changes in Worktrees Before Merge

### **Problem**
Worktrees had uncommitted changes (code review results) when merge was attempted, causing merge to fail.

### **Evidence from Production Logs**
```
[ERROR] Worktree has uncommitted changes. Please commit all changes before merging.
```

### **Root Cause**
- Code-reviewer added review report and updated story file
- Code-reviewer did NOT commit these changes
- Merge script detected uncommitted changes and failed

### **Fix Applied**

**File**: `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`
- Issue #1 fix ensures code-reviewer commits all changes

**File**: `.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh`
- Enhanced error messaging for uncommitted changes
- Shows uncommitted files with `git status --short`
- Provides exact commands to fix the issue

### **Result**
‚úÖ No uncommitted changes before merge (code-reviewer commits everything)
‚úÖ Better error messages if uncommitted changes detected
‚úÖ Clear resolution instructions provided

---

## ‚úÖ Issue #3: Merge Conflicts Due to Parallel Development

### **Problem**
Multiple stories developed in parallel created merge conflicts in shared files (package.json, package-lock.json).

### **Evidence from Production Logs**
```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in package-lock.json
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in package.json
```

### **Root Cause**
- Wave 1 has stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (all independent)
- All three stories branched from same commit on main
- Story 1.1 adds dependency X to package.json
- Story 1.2 adds dependency Y to package.json
- Story 1.3 adds dependency Z to package.json
- When merging in parallel:
  - Story 1.1 merges successfully (main now has X)
  - Story 1.2 tries to merge (conflict: main has X, branch has Y)
  - Story 1.3 tries to merge (conflict: main has X, branch has Z)

### **Fix Applied**

**File**: `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Step 4.5

**Replaced parallel merging with SEQUENTIAL merging:**

1. **Sort stories by ID** (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)
2. **For each story in order:**
   - Merge story ‚Üí main
   - Update remaining worktrees with latest main
   - Next story merges against updated main

**Merge Process:**
```
Wave 1: Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

1. Merge 1.1 ‚Üí main (main now has 1.1 changes)
2. Update 1.2 and 1.3 worktrees with latest main
3. Merge 1.2 ‚Üí main (main now has 1.1 + 1.2 changes)
4. Update 1.3 worktree with latest main
5. Merge 1.3 ‚Üí main (main now has 1.1 + 1.2 + 1.3 changes)
```

### **Result**
‚úÖ Eliminates merge conflicts in shared files (package.json, etc.)
‚úÖ Each story merges against latest main
‚úÖ Conflicts detected and resolved one at a time
‚úÖ Simpler conflict resolution (one story at a time)

---

## ‚úÖ Issue #4: Path Resolution Issues

### **Problem**
Initial merge attempts used relative paths that didn't resolve correctly from the main agent's working directory.

### **Evidence from Production Logs**
```
cd .worktrees/agent-react-developer-1-1-20251012-225658
no such file or directory
```

### **Root Cause**
- Main agent's working directory may not be repo root
- Relative paths like `.worktrees/...` failed if not in repo root
- git-worktree-manager.sh expected paths relative to repo root

### **Fix Applied**

**File**: `.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh`
- create_worktree function now returns ABSOLUTE path
- Uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to get repo root
- Returns `$repo_root/$worktree_path`

**File**: `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Step 4.2
- Added REPO_ROOT variable usage
- Capture absolute paths from create_worktree
- Store absolute paths in task state files
- Use absolute paths for all operations

**Usage:**
```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
WORKTREE_PATH=$($REPO_ROOT/.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "1.1" "nextjs-developer")
cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
```

### **Result**
‚úÖ Path resolution works from any directory
‚úÖ No more "no such file or directory" errors
‚úÖ Absolute paths stored in task state files
‚úÖ Consistent path handling across all operations
