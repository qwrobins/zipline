# Critical Git Workflow Violations - Analysis and Fixes

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

Based on Claude Code logs analysis, there are **4 critical git workflow violations** causing:
- Story files being modified on main branch
- Uncommitted changes in worktrees before merge
- Merge conflicts in parallel development
- Path resolution failures

---

## Issue 1: Code-Reviewer Modifying Story Files on Main Branch

### **Problem**
Code-reviewer is updating story files (adding review summaries) directly on the main branch instead of in the worktree where the story was implemented.

### **Evidence from Logs**
```
Already on 'main'
M  docs/stories/0.0.project-initialization.md
M  docs/stories/0.1.design-system-setup.md
M  docs/stories/1.1.display-current-time.md
```

### **Root Cause Analysis**

**File**: `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`
**Lines**: 578-594 (Step 7: Save Review Report)

**Current Behavior:**
1. Code-reviewer saves review report to `docs/code_reviews/[story-number]-code-review.md`
2. Code-reviewer uses `str-replace-editor` to add review summary to story file
3. **PROBLEM**: Code-reviewer is NOT in the worktree context when doing this
4. **RESULT**: Story file is modified on main branch, not in worktree

**Why This Happens:**
- Code-reviewer is invoked via `/review-story` command
- Command does NOT change directory to the worktree
- Code-reviewer operates in main repo directory
- All file modifications happen on main branch

### **Required Fix**

**Location**: `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` - Step 7

**Add BEFORE Step 7:**

```markdown
### Step 6.5: Verify Worktree Context (MANDATORY)

**üö® CRITICAL: Ensure you are operating in the correct worktree üö®**

**Before saving review report or updating story files:**

1. **Verify current git branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```
   - **MUST NOT be "main"**
   - **MUST be agent worktree branch** (e.g., `agent-nextjs-developer-1-1-20251012-225658`)

2. **If on main branch, STOP immediately:**
   - **DO NOT modify any files**
   - **DO NOT save review report**
   - **DO NOT update story status**
   - **ERROR**: Code-reviewer must be invoked from within the worktree directory

3. **Verify worktree path:**
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```
   - **MUST be in `.worktrees/agent-*` directory**
   - **MUST NOT be in main repo root**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: If not in worktree, ABORT review and report error**

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR: Code-reviewer is not operating in worktree context.
Current branch: main
Expected: agent worktree branch

Code-reviewer MUST be invoked from within the story's worktree directory.

To fix:
1. cd <worktree-path>
2. Re-invoke code-reviewer from within worktree
```
```

**Modify Step 7 (Lines 578-594):**

```markdown
### Step 7: Save Review Report and Update Story Status

**üö® PREREQUISITE: Step 6.5 verification MUST pass before proceeding üö®**

**For User Story Reviews:**

If reviewing code for a user story in `docs/stories/`:

1. **Save the full review report** to `docs/code_reviews/[story-number]-code-review.md`
   - Extract the story number from the story filename (e.g., `1.1-user-authentication.md` ‚Üí `1.1`)
   - Use **save-file** tool with path: `docs/code_reviews/[story-number]-code-review.md`
   - Include the complete review report from Step 6
   - **This file will be committed in the worktree branch**

2. **Add a brief reference** to the story file using **str-replace-editor**:
   ```markdown
   ## Code Review

   **Review Date**: [Current date]
   **Status**: [Approved / Approved with Comments / Changes Requested / Rejected]
   **Full Review**: See `docs/code_reviews/[story-number]-code-review.md`

   **Summary**: [1-2 sentence summary of findings]
   - Critical issues: [number]
   - Must fix before merge: [Yes/No]
   ```
   - **This modification happens in the worktree branch**

3. **Update story status** based on findings:
   - **If critical or high-severity issues**: Change status to "Changes Requested"
   - **If only medium/low issues**: Keep as "Ready for Review" with comments
   - **If approved**: Update status to "Approved"
   - **This modification happens in the worktree branch**

4. **Commit all changes in worktree (MANDATORY):**
   ```bash
   git add docs/code_reviews/[story-number]-code-review.md
   git add docs/stories/[story-file].md
   git commit -m "chore: Add code review for story [story-number]

   Review Status: [Approved/Changes Requested/etc.]
   Critical Issues: [number]
   Total Issues: [number]

   Full review: docs/code_reviews/[story-number]-code-review.md"
   ```

5. **Verify commit succeeded:**
   ```bash
   git log -1 --oneline
   ```
   - **MUST show the review commit**
   - **MUST be on worktree branch, NOT main**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: All changes MUST be committed before marking story as "Approved"**
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Do NOT leave uncommitted changes in worktree**
```

## Issue 2: Uncommitted Changes in Worktrees Before Merge

### **Problem**
Worktrees have uncommitted changes (code review results) when merge is attempted.

### **Evidence from Logs**
```
[ERROR] Worktree has uncommitted changes. Please commit all changes before merging.
```

### **Root Cause Analysis**

**File**: `.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh`
**Lines**: 215-220

**Current Behavior:**
```bash
# Check if there are uncommitted changes in the worktree
if ! git -C "$worktree_path" diff-index --quiet HEAD --; then
    log_error "Worktree has uncommitted changes. Please commit all changes before merging."
    cd "$original_dir"
    return 1
fi
```

**Why This Happens:**
- Code-reviewer adds review report and updates story file
- Code-reviewer does NOT commit these changes (Issue #1 fix addresses this)
- Merge script detects uncommitted changes and fails

### **Required Fix**

**Already addressed by Issue #1 fix** - Code-reviewer will now commit all changes in Step 7.4

**Additional Enhancement** - Add better error messaging:

**Location**: `.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh` - Lines 215-220

**Replace with:**
```bash
# Check if there are uncommitted changes in the worktree
if ! git -C "$worktree_path" diff-index --quiet HEAD --; then
    log_error "Worktree has uncommitted changes. Please commit all changes before merging."
    log_error ""
    log_error "Uncommitted files:"
    git -C "$worktree_path" status --short
    log_error ""
    log_error "To fix:"
    log_error "  cd $worktree_path"
    log_error "  git add -A"
    log_error "  git commit -m 'chore: commit pending changes'"
    log_error "  cd -"
    log_error "  $0 merge $worktree_path"
    cd "$original_dir"
    return 1
fi
```

## Issue 3: Merge Conflicts Due to Parallel Development

### **Problem**
Multiple stories developed in parallel are creating merge conflicts in shared files (package.json, package-lock.json).

### **Evidence from Logs**
```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in package-lock.json
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in package.json
```

### **Root Cause Analysis**

**File**: `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md`
**Lines**: 573-607 (Step 4.5: Merge and Cleanup)

**Current Behavior:**
```markdown
**For each approved story in wave:**

1. **Merge changes:**
   ```bash
   ./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh merge "<worktree-path>"
   ```
```

**Why This Happens:**
- Wave 1 has stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (all independent)
- All three stories branch from same commit on main
- Story 1.1 adds dependency X to package.json
- Story 1.2 adds dependency Y to package.json
- Story 1.3 adds dependency Z to package.json
- When merging:
  - Story 1.1 merges successfully (main now has X)
  - Story 1.2 tries to merge (conflict: main has X, branch has Y)
  - Story 1.3 tries to merge (conflict: main has X, branch has Z)

### **Required Fix**

**Location**: `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Step 4.5

**Replace Lines 573-607 with:**

```markdown
#### 4.5: Sequential Merge and Cleanup (Wave-Based)

**üö® CRITICAL: Merge stories SEQUENTIALLY within each wave to prevent conflicts üö®**

**After ALL stories in wave are approved:**

**Sequential Merge Process:**

1. **Sort stories by ID** (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)
   - Ensures consistent merge order
   - Prevents race conditions

2. **For EACH approved story in wave (in order):**

   a. **Merge changes:**
      ```bash
      ./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh merge "<worktree-path>"
      ```
      - Merges story branch into main
      - **If conflicts occur:**
        - STOP immediately
        - Report conflict to user
        - Provide conflict resolution instructions
        - Do NOT proceed to next story
        - Do NOT cleanup worktree (preserve for conflict resolution)

   b. **Verify merge succeeded:**
      ```bash
      git log -1 --oneline
      ```
      - **MUST show merge commit**
      - **MUST be on main branch**

   c. **Update main branch in remaining worktrees (CRITICAL):**
      ```bash
      # For each remaining story in wave that hasn't been merged yet
      for remaining_worktree in <remaining-worktrees>; do
          git -C "$remaining_worktree" fetch origin main:main
          git -C "$remaining_worktree" rebase main
      done
      ```
      - **This prevents conflicts in subsequent merges**
      - **Each story gets latest main before its merge**

   d. **Cleanup worktree:**
      ```bash
      ./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh cleanup "<worktree-path>"
      ```
      - Removes worktree directory
      - Deletes story branch
      - Frees up disk space

   e. **Update state:**
      - Mark story as "Completed" in state file
      - Record completion time
      - Update orchestration progress
      - Update dependency graph (mark as satisfied for dependent stories)

3. **Report wave merge completion:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Wave [N] Merged Successfully
   - [count] stories merged into main (sequential)
   - [count] worktrees cleaned up
   - Ready to proceed to Wave [N+1]
   ```

**Why Sequential Merging:**
- Prevents merge conflicts in shared files (package.json, etc.)
- Each story merges against latest main
- Conflicts are detected and resolved one at a time
- Simpler conflict resolution (one story at a time)

**Merge Order Example:**
```
Wave 1: Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

1. Merge 1.1 ‚Üí main (main now has 1.1 changes)
2. Rebase 1.2 and 1.3 worktrees on updated main
3. Merge 1.2 ‚Üí main (main now has 1.1 + 1.2 changes)
4. Rebase 1.3 worktree on updated main
5. Merge 1.3 ‚Üí main (main now has 1.1 + 1.2 + 1.3 changes)
```
```

## Issue 4: Path Resolution Issues

### **Problem**
Initial merge attempts used relative paths that didn't resolve correctly from the main agent's working directory.

### **Evidence from Logs**
```
cd .worktrees/agent-react-developer-1-1-20251012-225658
no such file or directory
```

### **Root Cause Analysis**

**File**: `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md`
**Lines**: Various locations using relative paths

**Why This Happens:**
- Main agent's working directory may not be repo root
- Relative paths like `.worktrees/...` fail if not in repo root
- git-worktree-manager.sh expects paths relative to repo root

### **Required Fix**

**Location**: `.claude/commands/implement-stories.md` - Multiple locations

**Add to Step 4.2 (Line 332):**

```markdown
#### 4.2: Launch All Stories in Wave (Parallel)

**üö® CRITICAL: Always use absolute paths for worktree operations üö®**

**Before launching stories:**

1. **Get repository root:**
   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```

2. **For each story in wave:**
   ```bash
   # Create worktree (returns absolute path)
   WORKTREE_PATH=$($REPO_ROOT/.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "1.1" "nextjs-developer")
   
   # Change to worktree using absolute path
   cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
   
   # Invoke developer agent
   # Agent works in worktree directory
   ```

3. **Store absolute paths in task state:**
   - Save `WORKTREE_PATH` to `.agent-orchestration/tasks/[story-id]-task.json`
   - Use absolute paths for all subsequent operations
```

**Enhance git-worktree-manager.sh:**

**Location**: `.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh` - create_worktree function

**Add after line 180 (end of create_worktree function):**

```bash
# Return absolute path to worktree
echo "$repo_root/$worktree_path"
```

This allows callers to capture the absolute path:
```bash
WORKTREE_PATH=$(./git-worktree-manager.sh create "1.1" "nextjs-developer")
```
