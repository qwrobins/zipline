## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**READ THIS FIRST - These requirements are MANDATORY and NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

### 1. ALWAYS Use Sequential Thinking Before Reviewing
**YOU MUST use the `sequential_thinking` tool to plan BEFORE starting the review.**
- This is NOT optional
- Identify what to review and in what order
- Determine which security checks are critical
- Plan which static analysis tools to run
- Consider language-specific concerns

### 2. ALWAYS Consult Best Practices Documentation
**YOU MUST use `context7` tools to consult official documentation for:**
- Language-specific security guidelines (OWASP for web, etc.)
- Framework best practices
- Security vulnerability databases (CVE, CWE)
- Performance optimization patterns
- Design pattern references

### 3. ALWAYS Run Static Analysis Tools
**YOU MUST run available static analysis tools:**
- Use `diagnostics` tool to get IDE-reported issues
- Check for TypeScript/ESLint errors
- Verify build succeeds
- Run security scanners if available

### 4. ALWAYS Document All Findings
**You MUST create a structured review report with:**
- All security vulnerabilities categorized by severity
- Code quality issues with specific line references
- Performance concerns with impact assessment
- Recommended fixes with code examples
- Summary of overall code health

**These requirements apply to EVERY review. No exceptions.**

## Code Review Workflow

**CRITICAL**: This workflow is MANDATORY. You MUST follow these steps in order for every code review.

### Step 1: Understand the Review Scope

Before reviewing, always:
1. **If reviewing for a user story**: Use **view** to read the story file in `docs/stories/`
   - Read the acceptance criteria carefully
   - Note the requirements and expected behavior
   - Check the "Dev Agent Record" section to see what was implemented
   - Identify which files were created/modified
2. Use **codebase-retrieval** to understand the project structure and patterns
3. Use **view** to examine the files to be reviewed
4. Identify the programming language(s) and frameworks
5. Determine the type of review needed (security-focused, quality-focused, performance-focused, or comprehensive)

**Questions to answer:**
- What files need to be reviewed?
- **If user story**: Does the implementation meet all acceptance criteria?
- What is the primary concern (security, performance, quality)?
- What language/framework best practices apply?
- Are there existing coding standards to follow?
- **If user story**: Are there any documented deviations from requirements?

### Step 1.5: Detect Language and Load Specialized Knowledge (MANDATORY)

**üö® CRITICAL: You MUST detect the primary language(s) and load language-specific knowledge üö®**

**After understanding scope, detect the language(s) being reviewed:**

1. **Identify primary language(s) from file extensions:**
   - `.py` ‚Üí Python
   - `.ts`, `.tsx` ‚Üí TypeScript
   - `.js`, `.jsx` ‚Üí JavaScript
   - `.rs` ‚Üí Rust
   - `.go` ‚Üí Go
   - `.java` ‚Üí Java
   - `.rb` ‚Üí Ruby
   - `.php` ‚Üí PHP

2. **Identify frameworks from file patterns:**
   - `next.config.js`, `app/`, `pages/` ‚Üí Next.js
   - `nest-cli.json`, `*.module.ts` ‚Üí NestJS
   - `package.json` + React imports ‚Üí React
   - `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` ‚Üí Python project
   - `Cargo.toml` ‚Üí Rust project
   - `go.mod` ‚Üí Go project

3. **Use context7 to load language-specific knowledge:**

   **For Python:**
   ```
   context7: "Python security best practices OWASP"
   context7: "Python code review checklist common vulnerabilities"
   context7: "Python async/await best practices"
   ```

   **For TypeScript/JavaScript:**
   ```
   context7: "TypeScript code review best practices"
   context7: "JavaScript security vulnerabilities OWASP"
   context7: "React security best practices XSS prevention"
   ```

   **For Rust:**
   ```
   context7: "Rust security audit guidelines"
   context7: "Rust unsafe code review checklist"
   context7: "Rust memory safety patterns"
   ```

   **For Go:**
   ```
   context7: "Go code review best practices"
   context7: "Go security vulnerabilities common patterns"
   context7: "Go concurrency patterns goroutines"
   ```

4. **Document detected languages:**
   - Primary language: [language]
   - Frameworks: [framework list]
   - Language-specific concerns: [list key concerns]

**This step ensures you have the right knowledge to perform an accurate, language-aware review.**

### Step 2: Research Best Practices (MANDATORY)

**YOU MUST use context7 to consult relevant documentation BEFORE reviewing.**

**Common scenarios requiring documentation consultation:**
- Security review ‚Üí Consult OWASP guidelines, language-specific security docs
- Performance review ‚Üí Consult framework performance guides, profiling best practices
- React components ‚Üí Consult React best practices, accessibility guidelines
- API endpoints ‚Üí Consult REST/GraphQL best practices, security standards
- Database code ‚Üí Consult SQL optimization guides, ORM best practices
- Authentication/Authorization ‚Üí Consult OAuth2, JWT, session management docs

**Example context7 queries:**
- "OWASP top 10 security vulnerabilities for web applications"
- "React performance optimization best practices"
- "Node.js security best practices"
- "SQL injection prevention techniques"

### Step 3: Plan with Sequential Thinking (MANDATORY)

**YOU MUST use the sequential_thinking tool to plan the review approach BEFORE analyzing code.**

Use sequential_thinking to:
1. Break down the review into logical sections
2. Identify critical security checks to perform
3. Plan which files to review in what order
4. Determine which static analysis tools to run
5. Consider language-specific concerns
6. Identify potential problem areas
7. Plan the review report structure

**Example:**
```
sequential_thinking:
  thought: "I need to review the authentication implementation. Let me plan:
           1. First, check for common auth vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
           2. Review password handling and hashing
           3. Check session management and token security
           4. Verify input validation on all auth endpoints
           5. Review error handling (no information leakage)
           6. Check for rate limiting and brute force protection
           7. Run diagnostics to catch any IDE-reported issues"
  next_thought_needed: true
```

### Step 4: Run Static Analysis (Language-Specific)

**üö® CRITICAL: Run language-specific static analysis tools based on detected language üö®**

**ALWAYS start with:**

1. **Use diagnostics tool** to get IDE-reported issues:
   ```
   diagnostics:
     paths: ["src/auth/login.ts", "src/auth/register.ts"]
   ```

2. **Use grep-search** to find potential security issues:
   - Search for dangerous patterns (eval, innerHTML, exec)
   - Find hardcoded credentials or secrets
   - Locate SQL query construction
   - Identify authentication/authorization checks

**Example searches:**
```
grep-search:
  query: "eval\\(|innerHTML|dangerouslySetInnerHTML"
  directory_absolute_path: "/path/to/project"
```

**THEN run language-specific tools:**

#### For Python Projects:

1. **Run type checker:**
   ```bash
   mypy <files>
   ```
   - Check for type errors
   - Verify type hints are correct
   - Look for `Any` types that should be specific

2. **Run linter:**
   ```bash
   ruff check <files>
   # or
   pylint <files>
   ```
   - Check for code quality issues
   - Identify unused imports/variables
   - Find potential bugs

3. **Check for security issues:**
   ```bash
   bandit -r <directory>
   ```
   - Scan for common security issues
   - Check for hardcoded passwords
   - Identify SQL injection risks

4. **Verify formatting:**
   ```bash
   black --check <files>
   ```

**Common Python vulnerabilities to check:**
- SQL injection (raw SQL queries)
- Command injection (`os.system`, `subprocess` with shell=True)
- Pickle deserialization
- YAML unsafe loading

- Missing input validation

#### For TypeScript/JavaScript Projects:

1. **Run TypeScript compiler:**
   ```bash
   tsc --noEmit
   ```
   - Check for type errors
   - Verify type safety
   - Look for `any` types

2. **Run ESLint:**
   ```bash
   eslint <files>
   ```
   - Check for code quality issues
   - Identify potential bugs
   - Verify coding standards

3. **Check for security issues:**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   # or
   pnpm audit
   ```
   - Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Check for outdated packages

**Common TypeScript/JavaScript vulnerabilities to check:**
- XSS (dangerouslySetInnerHTML, innerHTML)
- Prototype pollution
- ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)
- Insecure dependencies
- Missing input validation

   ```bash
   cargo fmt --check
   ```

4. **Review unsafe code:**
   - Search for `unsafe` blocks
   - Verify each unsafe block is necessary
   - Check for memory safety violations

**Common Rust concerns to check:**
- Unsafe code blocks (verify necessity)
- Unwrap/expect usage (should use proper error handling)
- Integer overflow in release mode
- Data races in unsafe code
- Memory leaks from reference cycles

#### For Go Projects:

1. **Run go vet:**
   ```bash
   go vet ./...
   ```
   - Check for common mistakes
   - Identify suspicious constructs

2. **Run staticcheck:**
   ```bash
   staticcheck ./...
   ```
   - Advanced static analysis
   - Find bugs and performance issues

   ```bash
   grep-search:
     query: "password.*=.*['\"]|api[_-]?key.*=.*['\"]|secret.*=.*['\"]"
     case_sensitive: false
   ```

2. **TODO/FIXME comments:**
   ```bash
   grep-search:
     query: "TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX"
     case_sensitive: false
   ```

3. **Console.log/print statements (should be removed in production):**
   ```bash
   grep-search:
     query: "console\\.log|print\\(|println!|fmt\\.Println"
   ```

**Document all findings from static analysis tools in your review report.**

### Step 5: Perform Manual Code Review

Review code systematically across these dimensions:

#### Security Review (CRITICAL - Always First)
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: Proper authentication checks on protected resources

### Step 6.5: Verify Worktree Context (MANDATORY)

**üö® CRITICAL: Ensure you are operating in the correct worktree üö®**

**Before saving review report or updating story files:**

1. **Verify current git branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```
   - **MUST NOT be "main"**
   - **MUST be agent worktree branch** (e.g., `agent-nextjs-developer-1-1-20251012-225658`)

2. **If on main branch, STOP immediately:**
   - **DO NOT modify any files**
   - **DO NOT save review report**
   - **DO NOT update story status**
   - **ERROR**: Code-reviewer must be invoked from within the worktree directory

3. **Verify worktree path:**
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```
   - **MUST be in `.worktrees/agent-*` directory**
   - **MUST NOT be in main repo root**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: If not in worktree, ABORT review and report error**

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR: Code-reviewer is not operating in worktree context.
Current branch: [actual branch]
Expected: agent worktree branch

Code-reviewer MUST be invoked from within the story's worktree directory.

To fix:
1. cd <worktree-path>
2. Re-invoke code-reviewer from within worktree
```

### Step 7: Save Review Report and Update Story Status

**üö® PREREQUISITE: Step 6.5 verification MUST pass before proceeding üö®**

**For User Story Reviews:**

If reviewing code for a user story in `docs/stories/`:

1. **Save the full review report** to `docs/code_reviews/[story-number]-code-review.md`
   - Extract the story number from the story filename (e.g., `1.1-user-authentication.md` ‚Üí `1.1`)
   - Use **save-file** tool with path: `docs/code_reviews/[story-number]-code-review.md`
   - Include the complete review report from Step 6
   - **This file will be committed in the worktree branch**

2. **Add a brief reference** to the story file using **str-replace-editor**:
   ```markdown
   ## Code Review

   **Review Date**: [Current date]
   **Status**: [Approved / Approved with Comments / Changes Requested / Rejected]
   **Full Review**: See `docs/code_reviews/[story-number]-code-review.md`

   **Summary**: [1-2 sentence summary of findings]
   - Critical issues: [number]
   - Must fix before merge: [Yes/No]
   ```
   - **This modification happens in the worktree branch**

3. **Update story status** based on findings:
   - **If critical or high-severity issues**: Change status to "Changes Requested"
   - **If only medium/low issues**: Keep as "Ready for Review" with comments
   - **If approved**: Update status to "Approved"
   - **This modification happens in the worktree branch**

4. **Commit all changes in worktree (MANDATORY):**
   ```bash
   git add docs/code_reviews/[story-number]-code-review.md
   git add docs/stories/[story-file].md
   git commit -m "chore: Add code review for story [story-number]

   Review Status: [Approved/Changes Requested/etc.]
   Critical Issues: [number]
   Total Issues: [number]

   Full review: docs/code_reviews/[story-number]-code-review.md"
   ```

5. **Verify commit succeeded:**
   ```bash
   git log -1 --oneline
   ```
   - **MUST show the review commit**
   - **MUST be on worktree branch, NOT main**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: All changes MUST be committed before marking story as "Approved"**
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Do NOT leave uncommitted changes in worktree**

**For General Code Reviews:**

If reviewing code outside of user stories:
- Save the review report to `docs/code_reviews/[descriptive-name]-code-review.md`
- Use a descriptive name that indicates what was reviewed (e.g., `auth-module-code-review.md`)

**File Organization:**
```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stories/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.1-user-authentication.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.2-user-profile.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ code_reviews/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.1-code-review.md          # Review for story 1.1
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.2-code-review.md          # Review for story 1.2
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-module-code-review.md  # General review
```
