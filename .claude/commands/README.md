### Story Orchestration

### `/implement-stories [scope]`
**Execute implementation using pre-built orchestration state**

Loads orchestration state created by `/automate-planning` and coordinates implementation from start to finish.

**Prerequisites**:
- **MUST run `/automate-planning` first** to create orchestration infrastructure
- Requires `.agent-orchestration/` directory with dependency graph, task states, and roadmap

**Usage**:
```bash
# Implement all stories
/implement-stories

# Implement a range of stories
/implement-stories 1.1-1.5

# Implement specific stories
/implement-stories 1.1 1.3 1.5

/implement-stories epic:auth

# Implement stories matching a pattern
/implement-stories 1.*
```

**What it does**:
1. Parses scope arguments (if provided)
2. **Loads orchestration state** from `.agent-orchestration/`
3. Filters stories based on scope
4. Warns about out-of-scope dependencies
5. Executes stories in parallel waves (based on dependency graph)
6. Coordinates code reviews after each story
7. Handles review feedback loops
8. Manages git worktrees for parallel execution
9. Tracks progress in state files

**When to use**:
- After running `/automate-planning`

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### First Time Setup (Complete Planning + Implementation)

1. **Create a product brief** at `docs/product-brief.md` with your project requirements

2. **Run automated planning** to generate all planning docs and orchestration state:
   ```bash
   /automate-planning docs/product-brief.md
   ```

   This creates:
   - `docs/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
   - `docs/stories/` - Individual user story files
   - `.agent-orchestration/` - Dependency graph, roadmap, task states
   - (Optional) `docs/architecture.md` - Architecture document
   - (Optional) `docs/design/` - Design specification

3. **Review generated artifacts**:
   - Review PRD and stories for accuracy
   - Review implementation roadmap: `.agent-orchestration/roadmap.md`
   - Verify dependency graph makes sense

4. **Execute implementation**:
   ```bash
   /implement-stories
   ```

5. **Monitor progress**:
   ```bash
   /story-status
   ```

### Alternative: Manual Story Creation

If you prefer to create stories manually:

1. **Create user stories** in `docs/stories/` directory:
   ```
   docs/stories/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 0.0-project-initialization.md
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 0.1-design-system-foundation.md
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.1-user-authentication.md
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.2-user-profile.md
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.3-password-reset.md
   ```

2. **Run planning to build orchestration state**:
   ```bash
   /automate-planning
   ```
   (Skip PRD/architecture/design generation, just build orchestration infrastructure)

3. **Execute implementation**:
   ```bash
   /implement-stories
   ```

### Typical Workflow

**Complete Workflow** (From requirements to implementation):
```bash
# Step 1: Planning (creates all planning docs + orchestration state)
/automate-planning docs/product-brief.md

# Step 2: Review generated planning artifacts
# - Review docs/prd.md
# - Review docs/stories/
# - Review .agent-orchestration/roadmap.md

# Step 3: Execute implementation (all stories)
/implement-stories

# Or scope to specific stories
/implement-stories 1.1-1.5

# Or work on an epic
/implement-stories epic:auth

# Check progress anytime
/story-status

# Resume if interrupted
/implement-stories
```

**Automated Approach** (When planning already done):
```bash
# If /automate-planning was already run, just execute
/implement-stories

# Or scope to specific stories
/implement-stories 1.1-1.5

# Check progress anytime
/story-status

# Resume if interrupted
/implement-stories
```

**Manual Approach** (More control):
```bash
# After /automate-planning, work on stories one at a time
/next-story
# ... wait for completion ...
/review-story 1.1
# ... wait for review ...

# Continue with next
/next-story
/review-story 1.2

# Check progress
/story-status
```

**Hybrid Approach** (Best of both):
```bash
# Start automated workflow
/implement-stories

# Pause when needed (press Escape)
# Check status
/story-status

# Continue manually
/next-story

# Or resume automated
/implement-stories
```

## üìÅ State Management

All commands use state files in `.agent-orchestration/`:

```
.agent-orchestration/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.json              # Overall metrics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dependency-graph.json      # Story relationships
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roadmap.md                 # Implementation plan
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.1-task.json         # Story 1.1 state
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1.2-task.json         # Story 1.2 state
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**State Persistence**:
- State is automatically saved after each operation
- Work can be paused and resumed at any time
- Progress is preserved across sessions
- State files can be committed to git for team visibility

## üéØ Best Practices

### Story File Format

Ensure story files include:
- **Story ID** in filename (e.g., `1.1-user-authentication.md`)
- **Status** field
- **Dependencies** section (if any)
- **Acceptance Criteria**
- **Technology stack** mentions

Example:
```markdown
# Story 1.2: User Profile

**Status**: Not Started
**Dependencies**: 1.1

## Description
...

## Technology Stack
- React, TypeScript, Next.js

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ...
2. ...
```

### Dependency Management

- Use clear, explicit dependencies
- Follow consistent numbering (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.)
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Document why dependencies exist

### Progress Tracking

- Run `/story-status` regularly
- Check state files for detailed info
- Commit state files to track team progress
- Review roadmap before starting work

### Error Recovery

If something goes wrong:
1. Run `/story-status` to see current state
2. Check `.agent-orchestration/tasks/` for details
3. Manually fix state files if needed
4. Resume with `/next-story` or `/implement-stories`

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Orchestration system not initialized"
**Solution**: Run `/implement-stories` to initialize

### "No stories ready to start"
**Solution**: Check `/story-status` to see what's blocking progress

### "Story stuck in 'in_progress'"
**Solution**: 
1. Check if dev agent completed work
2. Verify story status was updated
3. Manually update state file if needed

### "Circular dependency detected"
**Solution**: 
1. Review dependency graph in `.agent-orchestration/dependency-graph.json`
2. Identify the cycle
3. Remove one dependency to break the cycle

### "Review never completes"
**Solution**:
1. Check if review file was created in `docs/code_reviews/`
2. Verify code-reviewer agent finished
3. Manually update task state if needed
