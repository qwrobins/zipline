# Story Implementation Orchestration Workflow

You are orchestrating the implementation of user stories from the `docs/stories/` directory. Follow this comprehensive workflow to analyze, plan, and coordinate the implementation of all stories in the correct dependency order.

## üö® CRITICAL: Mandatory Code Review Enforcement üö®

**EVERY story implementation MUST be followed by an immediate code review.**

**The workflow is:**
1. Implement Story N
2. **STOP** ‚Üí Trigger code review for Story N
3. **WAIT** ‚Üí Wait for code review completion
4. **FIX** ‚Üí Address any issues found
5. **DOCUMENT** ‚Üí Add review results to story
6. **ONLY THEN** ‚Üí Proceed to Story N+1

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. No exceptions. No shortcuts.**

## USAGE

```bash
# Implement all stories
/implement-stories

# Implement a range of stories
/implement-stories 1.1-1.5

# Implement specific stories
/implement-stories 1.1 1.3 1.5

# Implement stories in an epic
/implement-stories epic:auth

# Implement stories matching a pattern
/implement-stories 1.*
```

## ARGUMENTS

The command accepts optional `$ARGUMENTS` to scope which stories to implement:

### **No Arguments** (Default)
Implements ALL stories in `docs/stories/`

### **Range Syntax** (1.1-1.5)
Implements stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 (inclusive range)

### **Specific Stories** (1.1 1.3 1.5)
Implements only the specified stories

### **Epic Scope** (epic:auth)
Implements all stories tagged with epic "auth"

### **Pattern Matching** (1.*)
Implements all stories matching the pattern

**See `.claude/agents/agent-guides/orchestration-patterns.md` for detailed argument parsing logic.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - Git Worktree Isolation ‚ö†Ô∏è

**MANDATORY WORKTREE USAGE:**

When multiple agents work simultaneously, they MUST use isolated git worktrees to prevent conflicts.

**Orchestrator Responsibilities:**

1. **Before assigning a story to an agent:**
   - Create a worktree using: `./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "{story-id}" "{agent-name}"`
   - Save the worktree path in the task state file
   - Provide the worktree path to the agent

2. **During story implementation:**
   - Track active worktrees in `.agent-orchestration/worktree-registry.json`
   - Monitor for abandoned worktrees (older than 24 hours)
   - Ensure agents work exclusively in their worktrees

3. **After story completion:**
   - Verify the agent merged their worktree
   - Verify the agent cleaned up their worktree
   - If cleanup failed, manually cleanup: `./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh cleanup "{worktree-path}"`

4. **Error handling:**
   - If merge fails due to conflicts, STOP and report to user
   - Do NOT cleanup worktrees with merge conflicts
   - Provide clear instructions for manual conflict resolution

**See `.claude/agents/agent-guides/git-workflow.md` for complete workflow details.**

## üîß QUICK REFERENCE: Post-Review Handoff

**After code reviews are approved, BEFORE merge operations:**

1. **Check if stories are ready for merge:**
   ```bash
   ./.claude/agents/lib/worktree-readiness-checker.sh check <story-ids>
   ```

2. **If NOT ready (uncommitted changes found):**
   - Hand stories back to their original developer agents
   - Agents commit all changes in their worktrees
   - Re-run readiness check

3. **If ready (all clean):**
   - Proceed with sequential merge operations

**See `docs/post-review-handoff-fix.md` for complete details.**

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

1. **ALWAYS use git worktrees** for agent isolation to prevent conflicts
2. **ALWAYS use sequential_thinking** for complex planning and dependency resolution
3. **ALWAYS use context7** when uncertain about algorithms or best practices
4. **ALWAYS update state files** in `.agent-orchestration/` to track progress
5. **NEVER skip dependency checks** - stories must wait for dependencies to be approved
6. **ALWAYS verify test results** before marking stories as complete
7. **ALWAYS check for out-of-scope dependencies** and warn the user
8. **ALWAYS cleanup worktrees** after story completion or failure
9. **PRIORITIZE PARALLEL EXECUTION** - maximize parallelism by running independent stories simultaneously

**See `.claude/agents/agent-guides/git-workflow.md` for git worktree details.**
**See `.claude/agents/agent-guides/orchestration-patterns.md` for complete orchestration patterns.**

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Arguments and Determine Scope

**Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine which stories to implement:**
- No arguments ‚Üí All stories
- Range syntax ‚Üí Parse range
- Specific stories ‚Üí Parse list
- Epic scope ‚Üí Find stories in epic
- Pattern matching ‚Üí Match pattern

**See `.claude/agents/agent-guides/orchestration-patterns.md` for argument parsing details.**

### Step 2: Load Planning State

**üö® CRITICAL: This phase loads pre-existing planning artifacts created by `/automate-planning`**

#### 2.1: Verify Orchestration Infrastructure

1. **Check if `.agent-orchestration/` directory exists**
   - If NOT exists:
     ```
     ‚ùå ERROR: Orchestration infrastructure not found!

     The .agent-orchestration/ directory does not exist.
     This directory should have been created by the /automate-planning command.

     Please run /automate-planning first to:
     1. Create user stories
     2. Build dependency graph
     3. Match stories to agents
     4. Generate implementation roadmap

     Then run /implement-stories to execute the implementation.
     ```
     **STOP** - Do not proceed without orchestration infrastructure

#### 2.2: Load Dependency Graph

2. **Read `.agent-orchestration/dependency-graph.json`**
   - Extract:
     - All story nodes
     - Dependency edges
     - Implementation order
     - Parallel waves
     - Parallel opportunities
   - If file missing or invalid:
     ```
     ‚ùå ERROR: Dependency graph not found or invalid!

     Expected: .agent-orchestration/dependency-graph.json

     Please run /automate-planning to generate the dependency graph.
     ```
     **STOP** - Do not proceed without dependency graph

#### 2.3: Load Task State Files

3. **Scan `.agent-orchestration/tasks/` directory**
   - Read all `*-task.json` files
   - Build map of story ID ‚Üí task state
   - If directory missing or empty:
     ```
     ‚ùå ERROR: Task state files not found!

     Expected: .agent-orchestration/tasks/*.json

     Please run /automate-planning to generate task state files.
     ```
     **STOP** - Do not proceed without task state files

#### 2.4: Load Roadmap

4. **Read `.agent-orchestration/roadmap.md`**
   - Display roadmap to user for reference
   - If file missing, warn but continue (not critical)

#### 2.5: Apply Scope Filter

5. **Filter based on scope from Step 1:**
   - If scope is "all": use all stories from loaded state
   - If scope is range: filter loaded stories to range
   - If scope is epic: filter loaded stories to epic
   - If scope is pattern: filter loaded stories to pattern
   - If scope is list: filter loaded stories to specific IDs

6. **Filter dependency graph and waves:**
   - Remove out-of-scope stories from dependency graph
   - Recalculate parallel waves for in-scope stories only
   - Update implementation order for filtered set

#### 2.6: Check Out-of-Scope Dependencies

7. **For each in-scope story, check if dependencies are also in scope**
   - If dependencies are out of scope, warn the user:
     ```
     ‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: Story 1.3 depends on Story 1.1, which is not in scope.

     Options:
     1. Add Story 1.1 to scope (recommended)
     2. Continue anyway (Story 1.3 will be blocked)
     3. Cancel and adjust scope

     What would you like to do?
     ```

#### 2.7: Report Loaded State

8. **Report loaded state:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Planning State Loaded Successfully

   üìä Orchestration Infrastructure:
   - Dependency Graph: ‚úÖ Loaded
   - Task State Files: ‚úÖ Loaded ([count] stories)
   - Roadmap: ‚úÖ Loaded
   - Parallel Waves: [count] waves identified
   - Max Parallel Agents: [count]

   üìã Scope:
   - Total Stories in Scope: [count]
   - Out-of-Scope Dependencies: [count] warnings
   ```

### Step 3: Git Initialization Check

**üö® CRITICAL: Verify git is initialized BEFORE any story implementation begins üö®**

#### 3.1: Check Git Status

1. **Verify git repository exists:**
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
   ```
   - If succeeds ‚Üí Git is initialized, proceed to Step 4
   - If fails ‚Üí Git is NOT initialized, proceed to 3.2

#### 3.2: Initialize Git (If Missing)

2. **Initialize git repository (MANDATORY if missing):**
   ```bash
   # Initialize git repository
   git init

   # Create .gitignore if it doesn't exist
   if [ ! -f .gitignore ]; then
     cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
   node_modules/
   .env
   .env.local
   dist/
   build/
   .DS_Store
   *.log
   .agent-orchestration/
   .worktrees/
   EOF
   fi

   # Create initial commit
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"

   # Set default branch to "main"
   git branch -M main

   # Verify initialization succeeded
   git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
   ```

   **Error Handling:**
   - If `git init` fails ‚Üí STOP and report: "Failed to initialize git repository. Please check git installation."
   - If initial commit fails ‚Üí STOP and report: "Failed to create initial commit. Please check file permissions."
   - If verification fails ‚Üí STOP and report: "Git initialization verification failed. Please initialize git manually."

   **After successful initialization:**
   - Report: "‚úÖ Git repository initialized successfully. Proceeding with worktree workflow."
   - Continue to Step 4

#### 3.3: Enforce Worktree Workflow

3. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: The git worktree workflow is MANDATORY for ALL story implementations.**
   - There are NO exceptions to using git worktrees
   - Even if git was just initialized, worktrees MUST be used
   - NEVER proceed with story implementation without worktrees
   - NEVER work directly in the main repository

   **If worktree creation fails:**
   - STOP and report the error to the user
   - Do NOT attempt to work without worktrees
   - Provide troubleshooting guidance

### Step 4: Execute Stories in Waves (Parallel Execution)

**üöÄ CRITICAL: Execute stories in PARALLEL waves, not sequentially! üöÄ**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Each wave MUST complete code review before proceeding to the next wave ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Execution Strategy:**

1. **Process by Waves (NOT individual stories):**
   - Identify all stories in the current wave (stories with satisfied dependencies)
   - Launch ALL agents for the wave simultaneously
   - Wait for ALL stories in the wave to complete and pass code review
   - Only then proceed to the next wave

2. **NEVER process stories one-by-one if they can run in parallel**
   - This defeats the purpose of the parallel execution architecture
   - Always check if multiple stories can run simultaneously
   - Maximize parallelism to minimize total implementation time

**For each wave:**

#### 4.1: Identify Stories in Current Wave

1. **Determine which stories can run now:**
   - Stories with NO dependencies (Wave 0)
   - Stories whose dependencies are ALL completed and approved
   - Group these stories into the current wave

2. **Report wave composition:**
   ```
   üöÄ Wave [N]: [count] stories ready for parallel execution
   - Story [id]: [title] (@[agent])
   - Story [id]: [title] (@[agent])
   - Story [id]: [title] (@[agent])
   ```

#### 4.2: Launch All Stories in Wave (Parallel)

**üö® CRITICAL: You MUST create worktrees and invoke agents for ALL stories in the wave üö®**

**For EACH story in current wave, execute these steps:**

**Step 1: Create git worktree (MANDATORY)**

Execute the worktree creation script:
```bash
./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "<story-id>" "<agent-name>"
```

Example:
```bash
# For story 1.1 assigned to nextjs-developer
./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "1.1" "nextjs-developer"

# For story 1.2 assigned to python-developer
./.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "1.2" "python-developer"
```

This script will:
- Create a new branch: `story/<story-id>`
- Create worktree directory: `.worktrees/agent-<agent-name>-<story-id>-<timestamp>/`
- Return the worktree path
- Initialize the worktree with main branch code

**Step 2: Save worktree path**

Capture the worktree path returned by the script and save it to the task state file:
```json
{
  "storyId": "1.1",
  "status": "In Progress",
  "agent": "nextjs-developer",
  "worktree": ".worktrees/agent-nextjs-developer-1.1-20250112143022/",
  "dependencies": ["0.1"],
  "startTime": "2025-01-12T14:30:22Z"
}
```

**Step 3: Invoke agent in worktree**

Switch to the worktree directory and invoke the agent:
```bash
cd <worktree-path>

# Invoke the agent with the story file
# Example: @nextjs-developer, please implement story 1.1
# Story file: docs/stories/1.1-user-authentication.md
```

The agent will:
- Read the story file and acceptance criteria
- Implement the required functionality
- Write and run tests (ALL tests must pass)
- Update story file with Dev Agent Record
- Change story status to "Ready for Review"

**Step 4: Track progress**

Update state file in `.agent-orchestration/tasks/<story-id>-task.json`:
- Set status to "In Progress"
- Record start time
- Record worktree path
- Record agent name

**üö® CRITICAL: Launch ALL stories in the wave BEFORE waiting for any to complete üö®**

**üö® CRITICAL: Always use absolute paths for worktree operations üö®**

**Parallel Execution Pattern:**
```bash
# Get repository root for absolute paths
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

# Wave 1 has stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (all independent)

# Launch story 1.1 (don't wait)
# create_worktree returns ABSOLUTE path
WORKTREE_1_1=$($REPO_ROOT/.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "1.1" "nextjs-developer")
cd "$WORKTREE_1_1"
# Invoke @nextjs-developer for story 1.1
# Store WORKTREE_1_1 path in task state file

# Launch story 1.2 (don't wait)
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
WORKTREE_1_2=$($REPO_ROOT/.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "1.2" "python-developer")
cd "$WORKTREE_1_2"
# Invoke @python-developer for story 1.2
# Store WORKTREE_1_2 path in task state file

# Launch story 1.3 (don't wait)
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
WORKTREE_1_3=$($REPO_ROOT/.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh create "1.3" "nextjs-developer")
cd "$WORKTREE_1_3"
# Invoke @nextjs-developer for story 1.3
# Store WORKTREE_1_3 path in task state file

# NOW wait for all three to complete
```

**All stories in wave execute simultaneously in separate worktrees.**

**Path Management:**
- git-worktree-manager.sh returns ABSOLUTE paths
- Store absolute paths in task state files
- Use absolute paths for all subsequent operations (merge, cleanup, review)
- Never use relative paths like `.worktrees/...`

#### 4.3: Wait for Wave Completion

**Monitor all stories in wave:**

1. **Wait for ALL agents in wave to complete:**
   - Monitor each agent's progress
   - Collect test results as they complete
   - Track completion status in state files

2. **Check for failures:**
   - If any story fails:
     - Mark story as "Failed" in state file
     - Cleanup failed story worktree
     - Continue monitoring other stories
     - Report failure at end
   - If all stories succeed:
     - Mark stories as "Ready for Review"
     - Proceed to code review phase

3. **Report wave completion:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Wave [N] Implementation Complete
   - [count] stories completed successfully
   - [count] stories failed
   - Ready for code review
   ```

#### 4.4: Code Review (MANDATORY - Wave-Based)

**üö® CRITICAL: Review ALL stories in wave before proceeding to next wave üö®**

**For EACH completed story in wave:**

1. **Trigger code review:**
   ```bash
   /review-story <story-id>
   ```

2. **Wait for review completion:**
   - Review checks code quality
   - Review verifies tests pass
   - Review checks acceptance criteria met
   - Review validates no regressions

3. **If issues found:**

   **üö® CRITICAL: Main agent MUST NOT fix issues directly üö®**

   **Required workflow for fixes:**

   a. **Identify the original developer agent:**
      - Read task state file: `.agent-orchestration/tasks/<story-id>-task.json`
      - Extract `agent` field (e.g., "nextjs-developer", "python-developer")
      - Extract `worktree_path` field (existing worktree location)

   b. **Hand story back to ORIGINAL developer agent:**
      ```bash
      # Switch to the existing worktree
      cd <worktree_path>

      # Invoke the SAME developer agent that did original implementation
      # Pass code review feedback to the agent
      # Agent name from task state file (e.g., @nextjs-developer)
      ```

   c. **Developer agent fixes issues in EXISTING worktree:**
      - Developer agent reads code review feedback
      - Fixes issues in the worktree (NOT main branch)
      - Re-runs tests to verify fixes
      - Updates story file in worktree (NOT main branch)
      - Marks story as "Ready for Re-Review"

   d. **Re-invoke code-reviewer agent (NOT self-review):**
      ```bash
      /review-story <story-id>
      ```
      - Code-reviewer agent reviews the fixes
      - If still has issues: repeat steps a-d
      - If approved: proceed to step 4

   **üö® NEVER allow:**
   - Main agent fixing code directly
   - Creating new worktree for fixes (use existing worktree)
   - Self-review (agent reviewing its own fixes)
   - Updating story files on main branch

4. **Document review results (after approval):**
   - Add review results to story file (in worktree)
   - Update story status to "Approved" in state file
   - Record review completion time

5. **Track wave review progress:**
   ```
   üìã Wave [N] Code Review Progress:
   - Story [id]: ‚úÖ Approved
   - Story [id]: ‚úÖ Approved
   - Story [id]: üîÑ In Review
   - Story [id]: ‚ùå Issues Found (fixing...)
   ```

#### 4.4.1: Parallel Fix Execution (If Multiple Stories Have Issues)

**If multiple stories in wave have review issues:**

1. **Identify all stories needing fixes:**
   - Collect all story IDs with review issues
   - Read task state files for each story
   - Extract agent name and worktree path for each

2. **Hand ALL stories back to their developer agents IN PARALLEL:**
   ```bash
   # For each story with issues, invoke its developer agent simultaneously
   # Story 1.1 ‚Üí @nextjs-developer in worktree-1
   # Story 1.2 ‚Üí @python-developer in worktree-2
   # Story 1.3 ‚Üí @nextjs-developer in worktree-3
   # All agents work in parallel in separate worktrees
   ```

3. **Wait for ALL developer agents to complete fixes:**
   - Monitor all agents in parallel
   - Track completion status for each
   - Collect test results from each

4. **Re-review ALL fixed stories IN PARALLEL:**
   ```bash
   # Invoke code-reviewer for all fixed stories simultaneously
   /review-story 1.1
   /review-story 1.2
   /review-story 1.3
   ```

5. **If any still have issues:**
   - Repeat parallel fix process for remaining issues
   - Continue until ALL stories approved

**üö® CRITICAL: Maintain parallel execution even during fix cycles üö®**

**üö® CRITICAL: Do NOT proceed to next wave until ALL stories in current wave are reviewed and approved üö®**

**Wave Review Completion:**
- ALL stories must be approved
- NO stories can have pending issues
- ALL fixes must be tested and verified
- Only then proceed to post-review handoff

#### 4.4.2: Post-Review Handoff (CRITICAL FIX)

**üö® CRITICAL: After ALL stories in wave are approved, hand control back to developer agents to finalize changes üö®**

**This step is MANDATORY before any merge operations to prevent merge conflicts due to uncommitted changes.**

**For EACH approved story in wave (in parallel):**

1. **Identify the developer agent and worktree:**
   - Read task state file: `.agent-orchestration/tasks/<story-id>-task.json`
   - Extract `assigned_agent` field (e.g., "nextjs-developer", "python-developer")
   - Extract `worktree_path` field (existing worktree location)

2. **Hand story back to ORIGINAL developer agent for finalization:**
   ```bash
   # Switch to the existing worktree
   cd <worktree_path>

   # Invoke the SAME developer agent that did original implementation
   # Pass finalization instructions to the agent
   # Agent name from task state file (e.g., @nextjs-developer)
   ```

3. **Developer agent finalizes changes in EXISTING worktree:**
   - Developer agent reviews their working directory status
   - Commits ALL uncommitted changes (if any)
   - Ensures clean working directory: `git status` shows "working tree clean"
   - Updates story file with final implementation notes
   - Marks story as "Ready for Merge" in story file

4. **Verify clean working directory:**
   ```bash
   # Use the readiness checker to verify all worktrees in wave
   ./.claude/agents/lib/worktree-readiness-checker.sh check <story-id1> <story-id2> <story-id3>
   ```
   - **If any uncommitted changes found:** STOP and report error
   - **If all clean:** Proceed to merge operations

5. **Track finalization progress:**
   ```
   üìã Wave [N] Post-Review Finalization:
   - Story [id]: ‚úÖ Finalized (clean working directory)
   - Story [id]: ‚úÖ Finalized (clean working directory)
   - Story [id]: üîÑ Finalizing changes...
   - Story [id]: ‚ùå Has uncommitted changes (fixing...)
   ```

**üö® CRITICAL Requirements:**
- ALL developer agents work in parallel in their existing worktrees
- NO new worktrees created (use existing worktrees from implementation)
- ALL working directories MUST be clean before proceeding to merge
- Main agent MUST NOT attempt merge until ALL stories finalized

**Error Handling:**
- If any story has uncommitted changes after finalization attempt:
  - STOP the entire wave merge process
  - Report which stories have uncommitted changes
  - Provide clear instructions for manual resolution
  - Do NOT proceed to merge operations

**Only after ALL stories in wave are finalized with clean working directories:**
- Proceed to Sequential Merge and Cleanup (Step 4.5)

#### 4.5: Sequential Merge and Cleanup (Wave-Based)

**üö® CRITICAL: Merge stories SEQUENTIALLY within each wave to prevent conflicts üö®**

**After ALL stories in wave are approved AND finalized (Step 4.4.2 completed):**

**Sequential Merge Process:**

1. **Verify all stories are ready for merge:**
   ```bash
   # Check that all worktrees have clean working directories
   ./.claude/agents/lib/worktree-readiness-checker.sh check <story-id1> <story-id2> <story-id3>
   ```
   - **If check fails:** STOP and complete post-review handoff (Step 4.4.2)
   - **If check passes:** Proceed with merge operations

2. **Get repository root:**
   ```bash
   REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```

3. **Sort stories by ID** (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)
   - Ensures consistent merge order
   - Prevents race conditions
   - Example: `1.1` ‚Üí `1.2` ‚Üí `1.3`

4. **For EACH approved story in wave (in order):**

   a. **Merge changes:**
      ```bash
      $REPO_ROOT/.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh merge "<absolute-worktree-path>"
      ```
      - Merges story branch into main
      - **If conflicts occur:**
        - STOP immediately
        - Report conflict to user
        - Provide conflict resolution instructions:
          ```
          CONFLICT in story [story-id]

          To resolve:
          1. cd <worktree-path>
          2. git fetch origin main:main
          3. git rebase main
          4. Resolve conflicts manually
          5. git add <resolved-files>
          6. git rebase --continue
          7. Return to main agent to retry merge
          ```
        - Do NOT proceed to next story
        - Do NOT cleanup worktree (preserve for conflict resolution)

   b. **Verify merge succeeded:**
      ```bash
      cd $REPO_ROOT
      git log -1 --oneline
      ```
      - **MUST show merge commit**
      - **MUST be on main branch**

   c. **Update main branch in remaining worktrees (CRITICAL):**
      ```bash
      # For each remaining story in wave that hasn't been merged yet
      for remaining_worktree in <remaining-worktrees>; do
          git -C "$remaining_worktree" fetch origin main:main 2>/dev/null || true
          git -C "$remaining_worktree" merge main --no-edit 2>/dev/null || {
              echo "Note: Worktree $remaining_worktree may need manual rebase"
          }
      done
      ```
      - **This prevents conflicts in subsequent merges**
      - **Each story gets latest main before its merge**
      - **Failures are logged but don't stop the process**

   d. **Cleanup worktree:**
      ```bash
      $REPO_ROOT/.claude/agents/lib/git-worktree-manager.sh cleanup "<absolute-worktree-path>"
      ```
      - Removes worktree directory
      - Deletes story branch
      - Frees up disk space

   e. **Update state:**
      - Mark story as "Completed" in state file
      - Record completion time
      - Update orchestration progress
      - Update dependency graph (mark as satisfied for dependent stories)

4. **Report wave merge completion:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Wave [N] Merged Successfully
   - [count] stories merged into main (sequential)
   - [count] worktrees cleaned up
   - Ready to proceed to Wave [N+1]
   ```

**Why Sequential Merging:**
- Prevents merge conflicts in shared files (package.json, package-lock.json, etc.)
- Each story merges against latest main
- Conflicts are detected and resolved one at a time
- Simpler conflict resolution (one story at a time)
- Remaining worktrees updated with latest main before their merge

**Merge Order Example:**
```
Wave 1: Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

1. Merge 1.1 ‚Üí main (main now has 1.1 changes)
2. Update 1.2 and 1.3 worktrees with latest main
3. Merge 1.2 ‚Üí main (main now has 1.1 + 1.2 changes)
4. Update 1.3 worktree with latest main
5. Merge 1.3 ‚Üí main (main now has 1.1 + 1.2 + 1.3 changes)
```

### Step 5: Progress to Next Wave

**After current wave is complete:**
- Verify all stories approved
- Check no merge conflicts
- Proceed to next wave
- Repeat Step 4 for next wave

**Continue until all waves complete.**

### Step 6: Final Summary

**After all stories complete:**

```
‚úÖ Story Implementation Complete

Total Stories: [count]
‚úÖ Completed: [count]
‚ùå Failed: [count]
‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipped: [count]

Failed Stories:
  - [story-id]: [reason]

Next Steps:
  1. Review failed stories
  2. Fix issues and re-run
  3. All stories ready for deployment
```

## State Management

**Track orchestration state in `.agent-orchestration/`:**

**Story state file:** `.agent-orchestration/story-<story-id>.json`
```json
{
  "storyId": "1.1",
  "status": "In Progress",
  "agent": "python-developer",
  "worktree": ".worktrees/agent-python-developer-1.1-...",
  "dependencies": ["0.1"],
  "startTime": "2025-01-12T14:30:22Z"
}
```

**Orchestration state:** `.agent-orchestration/orchestration-state.json`
```json
{
  "totalStories": 15,
  "completed": 3,
  "inProgress": 5,
  "pending": 7,
  "currentWave": 2
}
```

**See `.claude/agents/agent-guides/orchestration-patterns.md` for complete state management patterns.**

## Error Handling

### Story Failure
- Mark story as "Failed"
- Cleanup worktree
- Continue with other stories
- Report at end

### Dependency Failure
- Mark dependent stories as "Blocked"
- Skip blocked stories
- Report to user

### Agent Failure
- Capture error output
- Cleanup worktree
- Mark story as "Failed"
- Continue with other stories

**See `.claude/agents/agent-guides/orchestration-patterns.md` for error handling patterns.**

## Best Practices

1. **Maximize parallel execution** - Default to parallel, only sequential when dependencies require
2. **Always use git worktrees** - Prevents conflicts, enables true parallelism
3. **Verify dependencies** - Never skip dependency checks
4. **Monitor progress** - Update state files, provide real-time feedback
5. **Handle failures gracefully** - Isolate failures, continue with independent stories
6. **Mandatory code review** - Review EVERY story before proceeding
7. **Cleanup resources** - Always cleanup worktrees after completion

**See `.claude/agents/agent-guides/orchestration-patterns.md` for complete best practices and patterns.**
