description: Automate the complete planning process from initial requirements through to epic and story creation
---

You are orchestrating the complete planning workflow from initial requirements through to epic and story creation. This command automates the entire planning process by calling the appropriate agents in sequence.

# Instructions

## Step 1: Gather Initial Requirements

### 1.1: Get Product Brief Input

**If a product brief path was provided as an argument**:
- Read the product brief file using the `view` tool
- Validate the file exists and contains requirements

**If no product brief path was provided**:
- Ask the user to provide either:
  - A file path to an existing product brief document, OR
  - A text description of the project/feature requirements
- Wait for user response before proceeding

### 1.2: Get Planning Preferences

Ask the user which documents they would like to generate:

```
Would you like to generate an architecture document or front end spec?

1. Generate an Architecture Document
2. Generate front end specification
3. Both
4. Neither

Enter your choice (1-4):
```

Wait for user response before proceeding to Step 2.

## Step 2: AI Framework Selection (Conditional)

**ONLY execute this step if AI features are detected in the product brief.**

### 2.1: Detect AI Requirements

**Scan for AI-related keywords:**
- See `.claude/agents/agent-guides/ai-framework-selection.md` for complete detection patterns
- Conversational AI, Content Generation, Code Analysis, NLP, AI-Powered Features, Model Integration

**Extract existing configuration from product brief:**
- Framework preferences (Claude Agent SDK, Mastra AI)
- Model specifications (claude-3-5-sonnet, gpt-4o, gemini-pro)
- Configuration settings (temperature, providers, fallbacks)

### 2.2: Determine Configuration Approach

**If complete AI configuration found in product brief:**
- Extract and validate configuration
- Skip interactive prompts
- Proceed to Step 2.5 (Validate and Store)

**If partial or no AI configuration found:**
- Proceed to Step 2.3 (Interactive Configuration)

### 2.3: Interactive AI Framework Configuration

**Only prompt for information not already specified in the product brief.**

#### Framework Selection

**If framework not specified, ask:**

```
ðŸ¤– AI Framework Selection

Choose your AI integration approach:

1. **Claude Agent SDK** (Simpler, single-provider)
   - Best for: Straightforward AI needs, new to AI development
   - Provider: Anthropic Claude only

2. **Mastra AI Framework** (Flexible, multi-provider)
   - Best for: High availability, cost optimization, multi-agent workflows
   - Providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (with fallbacks)

Enter your choice (1-2, or 'help' for recommendations):
```

**If user requests help:**
- See `.claude/agents/agent-guides/ai-framework-selection.md` for recommendation criteria
- Provide tailored recommendation based on project needs

#### Provider and Model Selection

**For Claude Agent SDK:**
- Default to claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
- Ask for temperature (default 0.7)
- Ask about custom tools (default No)

**For Mastra AI Framework:**
- Prompt for primary provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- Show provider-specific model options (see guide for details)
- Ask about fallback provider (recommended for production)
- Ask about multi-agent workflows (optional)
- Ask about priority (cost, performance, reliability)

**All provider/model details:** See `.claude/agents/agent-guides/ai-framework-selection.md`

### 2.4: Validate and Store AI Configuration

**Validate configuration:**
- Framework choice is valid
- Model names are current and available
- Provider/model compatibility
- Configuration completeness

**Store configuration for use in subsequent planning steps.**

**Required AI Configuration Documentation:**

```markdown
## AI Integration

**Framework**: [Claude Agent SDK | Mastra AI Framework]
**Primary Model**: [model-name]
**Temperature**: [0.0-1.0]
**Fallback Provider**: [provider-name | None]
**Multi-Agent**: [Yes | No]
**Custom Tools**: [Yes | No]
```

## Step 3: Generate Architecture Document (Conditional)

**Execute if user selected option 1 or 3 in Step 1.2**

### 3.1: Invoke Architecture Agent

**Call the architecture agent:**
- Provide product brief content
- Include AI configuration (if applicable)
- Request architecture document generation

**Expected output:**
- `docs/architecture/architecture.md`
- System architecture overview
- Technology stack decisions
- Component architecture
- Data flow diagrams
- Deployment architecture
- AI integration architecture (if applicable)

### 3.2: Verify Architecture Document

**Validate output:**
- File exists at correct location
- Contains all required sections
- AI configuration properly documented (if applicable)
- No placeholder content

## Step 4: Generate Frontend Design Specification (Conditional)

**Execute if user selected option 2 or 3 in Step 1.2**

### 4.1: Invoke Frontend Design Agent

**Call the frontend-design agent:**
- Provide product brief content
- Request design specification generation

**Expected output:**
- `docs/design/frontend-design-spec.md`
- Design system (colors, typography, spacing)
- Component specifications
- User flows
- Accessibility requirements
- Responsive design guidelines

### 4.2: Verify Design Specification

**Validate output:**
- File exists at correct location
- Contains all required sections
- Design system fully defined
- Component specs complete

## Step 5: Generate Product Requirements Document

### 5.1: Invoke PRD Agent

**Call the PRD creation agent:**
- Provide product brief content
- Include architecture document (if generated)
- Include design specification (if generated)
- Include AI configuration (if applicable)

**Expected output:**
- `docs/requirements/prd.md`
- Product overview
- User personas
- Feature requirements
- Technical requirements
- Success metrics
- Timeline and milestones

### 5.2: Verify PRD

**Validate output:**
- File exists at correct location
- Contains all required sections
- References architecture and design docs (if applicable)
- AI requirements documented (if applicable)

## Step 6: Generate Epics and Stories

### 6.1: Invoke Scrum Master Agent

**Call the scrum-master agent:**
- Provide PRD content
- Provide architecture document (if generated)
- Provide design specification (if generated)
- Request epic and story generation

**Expected output:**
- `docs/stories/README.md` (Epic overview)
- `docs/stories/0.0.project-initialization.md` (if no codebase)
- `docs/stories/0.1.design-system-foundation-setup.md` (always)
- `docs/stories/[epic].[story].[title].md` (Feature stories)

### 6.2: Verify Stories

**Validate output:**
- README.md exists with epic overview
- Foundation stories generated correctly
- All feature stories have:
  - Clear acceptance criteria
  - Proper dependencies
  - Appropriate sizing
  - Design tokens (for UI stories)

## Step 7: Summary and Next Steps

### 7.1: Display Planning Summary

**Show user what was generated:**

```
âœ… Planning Complete

Documents Generated:
  âœ… Architecture Document: docs/architecture/architecture.md
  âœ… Design Specification: docs/design/frontend-design-spec.md
  âœ… Product Requirements: docs/requirements/prd.md
  âœ… Epic Overview: docs/stories/README.md
  âœ… Stories: [count] stories in docs/stories/

AI Configuration:
  Framework: [framework-name]
  Primary Model: [model-name]
  Temperature: [value]

Next Steps:
  1. Review generated documents
  2. Refine requirements if needed
  3. Run /implement-stories to begin development
```

### 7.2: Suggest Next Actions

**Recommend next steps:**
- Review all generated documents
- Make any necessary adjustments
- Run `/story-status` to see story overview
- Run `/implement-stories` to begin implementation
- Run `/next-story` to implement stories one at a time

## Error Handling

### Missing Product Brief
- Prompt user for product brief
- Validate input before proceeding
- Provide clear error messages

### Agent Failures
- Capture error output
- Report which step failed
- Suggest manual intervention
- Provide recovery options

### Validation Failures
- Report missing or incomplete sections
- Suggest corrections
- Allow user to retry or proceed

## Best Practices

1. **Always validate inputs** before calling agents
2. **Check outputs** after each agent completes
3. **Provide clear progress updates** to user
4. **Handle errors gracefully** with recovery options
5. **Store AI configuration** for use across all planning documents
6. **Reference guide files** for detailed information instead of embedding verbose content
